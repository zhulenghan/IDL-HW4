0,HE HOPED THERE WOULD BE STEW FOR DINNER TURNIPS AND CARROTS AND BRUISED POTATOES AND FAT AND MUTTON PIECES TO BE LAIDLED OUT IN THICK PEVERED FLOWER FAT AND SAUCE
1,STEP IT INTO YOU HIS BELLY COUNSELLED HIM
2,AFTER EARLY NIGHTFALL THE YELLOW LAMPS WOULD LIGHT UP HERE AND THERE THE SQUALLAD QUARTER OF THE BROTHLES
3,YOU'LL BEARTY AND HE'D IN YOUR MIND
4,NAM BUT THEN FRESH NELLY IS WAITING ON YOU COULD NOT HUSBAND
5,THE MUSIC CAME NEARER AND HE RECALLED THE WORDS THE WORDS OF SHALLY'S FRAGMENT UPON THE MOON WANDERING COMPANIONLESS PALE FOR WEARINESS
6,THE DULL LIGHT FELL MORE FAINTLY UPON THE PAGE WHERE ON ANOTHER REPLATION BEGAN TO ONEFOLD ITSELF SLOWLY AND TO SPREAD ABROAD ITS WIDENING TAIL
7,A COLD LUCID INDIFFERENCE REIGNED IN HIS SOUL
8,THE CHAOS IN WHICH HIS ARDOUR EXTINGUISHED ITSELF WAS A COLD INDIFFERENT KNOWLEDGE OF HIMSELF
9,AT MOST BY AN ALMS GIVEN TO A BEGGAR WHOSE BLESSING HE FLED FROM HE MIGHT HOPE WEARILY TO WIN FOR HIMSELF SOME MEASURE OF ACTUAL GRACE
10,WELL NOW IT IS I DECLARE YOU HAVE A HEAD AND SO HAS MY STICK
11,ON SATURDAY MORNING'S WHEN THE SUDALITY MET IN THE CHAPEL TO RECITE THE LITTLE OFFICE HIS PLACE WAS AT CUSHIONED KNEELING DESK AT THE RIGHT OF THE ALTAR FROM WHICH HE LED HIS WING OF BOYS THROUGH THE RESPONSEES
12,HER EYES SEEMED TO REGARD HIM WITH MILD PITY HER HOLINESS A STRANGE LIGHT GLOWING FAINTLY UPON HER FRAIL FLESH DID NOT HUMILIATE THE SINNER WHO APPROACHED HER
13,IF EVER HE WAS IMPELLED TO CAST SIN FROM HIM AND TO REPENT THE IMPULSE THAT MOVED HIM WAS THE WISH TO BE HER NIGHT
14,HE TRIED TO THINK HOW IT COULD BE
15,BUT THE DUSK DEEPENING IN THE SCHOOL ROOM COVERED OVER HIS THOUGHTS THE BELL RANG
16,THEN HE CAN ASK HIM QUESTIONS ON THE CATICISM DOUBTLESS
17,STEPHEN LEANING BACK AND DRAWING IDLY ON HIS SCRIBBLER LISTENED TO THE TALK ABOUT HIM WHICH HARRY CHEPPED FROM TIME TO TIME BY SAYING
18,IT WAS STRANGE TOO THAT HE FOUND AN ARID PLEASURE IN FOLLOWING UP TO THE END THE RIGID LINES OF THE DOCTRINES OF THE CHURCH AND PENETRATING INTO OBSCURE SILENCE AS ONLY TO HEAR AND FEEL THE MORE DEEPLY HIS OWN CONDEMNATION
19,THE SENTENCE OF SAINT JAMES WHICH SAYS THAT HE WHO OFFENCE AGAINST ONE COMMANDMENT BECOMES GUILTY OF ALL HAD SEEN TO HIM FIRST A SWOLLEN PHRASE UNTIL HE HAD BEGUN TO GROPE IN THE DARKNESS OF HIS OWN STATE
20,IF A MAN HAD STOLEN A POUND IN HIS YOUTH AND HAD USED THAT BOUND TO A MASSACHIAGE FORTUNE HOW MUCH WAS HE OBLIGED TO GIVE BACK THE POUND HE HAD STILL AN ONLY WERE THE POUND TOGETHER WITH THE COMPOUND INTEREST A CROWING UPON IT OR ALL HIS HUGE FORTUNE
21,IF A LEMON AND GIVING BACK TO HIM POOR THE WATER BEFORE SAYING THE WORDS IS THE CHILD BAPTIZED
22,HOW COMES IT THAT WHILE THE FIRST BE ATTITUDE PROMISES THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN TO THE POOR OF HEART THE SECOND BE ATTITUDE PROMISES ALSO TO THE MEAT THAT THEY SHALL POSSESS THE LAND
23,WHY WAS THE SACRED OF THE EUKURIST INSTITUTED UNDER THE TWO SPECIES OF BREAD AND WINE IF JESUS CHRIST BE PRESENT BODY AND BLOOD SOLE AND DIVINITY IN THE BREAD ALONE AND IN THE WINE ALONE
24,IF THE WINE CHANGE INTO VINEGAR AND THE HOST CRUMBLE INTO CORRUPTION AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN CONSECRATED IS JESUS CHRIST STILL PRESENT UNDER THEIR SPECIES AS GOD AND AS MAN
25,A GENTLE KICK FROM THE TALL BOY IN THE BENCH BEHIND URGED STEPHEN TO ASK A DIFFICULT QUESTION
26,THE RECTOR DID NOT ASK FOR A CATICISM TO HEAR THE LESSON FROM
27,HE CLASPED HIS HANDS ON THE DESK AND SAID
28,THE RETREAT WILL BEGIN ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON IN HONOR OF SAINT FRANCIS VIZIER WHOSE FEAST DAY IS SATURDAY
29,ON FRIDAY CONFESSION WILL BE HEARD ALL THE AFTERNOON AFTER BEADS
30,BEWHERE OF MAKING THAT MISTAKE
31,STEPHEN'S HEART BEGAN SLOWLY TO FOOL AND FADE WITH FEAR LIKE A WITHERING FLOWER
32,HE IS CALLED AS YOU KNOW THE APOSTLE OF THE INDIES
33,A GREAT SAINT SAINT SAINT FRANCIS'S EASIER
34,THE RECTOR PAUSED AND THEN SHAKING HIS CLASPED HANDS BEFORE HIM WENT ON
35,HE HAD TO FAITH IN HIM THAT MOVED MOUNTAINS
36,A GREAT SAINT SAINT SAINT FRANCIS'S EASIER
37,IN THE SILENCE THEIR DARK FIRE KINDLED THE DUSK INTO A TAWNY GLOW
38,HE COULD WAIT NO LONGER
39,FOR A FULL HOUR HE HAD PACED UP AND DOWN WAITING BUT HE COULD WAIT NO LONGER
40,HE SET OFF ABRUPTLY FOR THE BOWL WALKING RAPIDLY LESS HIS FATHER'S SHRILL WHISTLE MIGHT CALL HIM BACK AND IN A FEW MOMENTS HE HAD ROUND THE CURVE AT THE POLICE BARRACK AND WAS SAFE
41,THE UNION OF VERSITY
42,BRIGHT AFTER SATISFACTION UPLIFTED HIM LIKE LONG SLOW WAVES
43,WHO IS FEET ARE AS THE FEET OF HEARTS AND UNDERNEATH THE EVERLASTING ARMS
44,THE PRIDE OF THAT DIM IMAGE BROUGHT BACK TO HIS MIND THE DIGNITY OF THE OFFICE HE HAD REFUSED
45,SOON THE WHOLE BRIDGE WAS TREMBLING AND RESOUNDING
46,THE UNCOUTH FACES PASSED HIM TOO BY TOO STAYING YELLOW OR READ OR LIVE IT BY THE SEA AND AS HE STROVE TO LOOK AT THEM WITH EASE AND INDIFFERENCE A FAINT STAIN OF PERSONAL SHAME AND COMPOSITION ROSE TO HIS OWN FACE
47,AND READ WITH HIMSELF HE TRIED TO HIDE HIS FACE FROM THEIR EYES BY GAZING DOWN SIDEWAYS INTO THE SHALLOW SWIRLING WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE BUT HE STILL SAW A REFLECTION THEREIN OF THEIR TOP HEAVY SILK CATS AND HUMBLE TAKE LIKE COLORS AND LOOSELY HANGING CLERICAL CLOTHES BROTHER HICKY
48,BROTHER MC CARNAL BROTHER KIHIL
49,THEIR PIETY WOULD BE LIKE THEIR NAMES LIKE THEIR CLOTHES AND IT WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT THEIR HUMBLE AND CONTRACT HEARTS IT MIGHT BE PAID A FAR RICHER TRIBUTE OF DEVOTION THAN HIS HAD EVER BEEN A GIFT TENFOLD MORE ACCEPTABLE THAN HIS ELABORATE ADORATION
50,IT WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO MOVE HIMSELF TO BE GENEROUS TOWARDS THEM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT IF HE EVER CAME TO THEIR GATES STRIPPED OF HIS PRIDE BEET AND IN BEGGARS WEEDS THAT THEY WOULD BE GENEROUS TOWARDS HIM LOVING HIM AS THEMSELVES
51,I'LL AN EMBITTERING FINELY TO ARGUE AGAINST HIS OWN DISPASSIONATE SORTITUDE THAT THE COMMAND WOULD HAVE LOVE BIG US NOT TO LOVE OUR NEIGHBOUR AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME AMOUNT AND INTENSITY OF LOVE BUT TO LOVE HIM AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME KIND OF LOVE
52,THE PHRASE AND THE DAY AND THE SCENE HARMONIZED IN ACCORD
53, WORDS WAS AT THEIR COLORS
54,THEY WERE VOYAGING ACROSS THE DESERTS OF THE SKY A HOST OF NO MADS ON THE MARCH VOYAGE HIGH OVER ISLAND WESTWARD BOUND
55,THE EUROPE THEY HAD COME FROM LAY OUT THERE BEYOND THE IRISH SEA EUROPE OF STRANGE TONGUES AND VALLEY AND WOODPECKER AND SIT ADEL AND OF ENTRENCHED AND POWERFUL RACES
56,AGAIN AGAIN
57,A VOICE FROM BEYOND THE WORLD WAS CALLING
58,HER THOSE STEVENALS HERE COMES THE DATTLEAS
59,THEIR DIVING STONE POISED ON ITS RUDE SUPPORTS AND ROCKING UNDER THEIR PLUNCHES AND THE ROUGHHOONS OF THE SLOPING BREAKWATER OVER WHICH THEY SCRAMBLED IN THEIR HORSE PLAY GLEAMED WITH COLD WEATHER
60,HE STOOD STILL INDIFFERENCE TO THEIR CAUSE AND BURIED THEIR BATTER WITH EASY WORDS
61,IT WAS A PAIN TO SEE HIM AND A SWORD LIKE PAIN TO SEE THE SIGNS OF ADOLESCENCE THAT MADE REPELANT THEIR PITIABLE NAKEDNESS
62,STEPHENALLS DEAD LOSS
63,A MOMENT BEFORE THE GHOST OF THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF THE DANES HAD LOOKED FORTH THROUGH THE VESTURE OF THE HEZRAPPED CITY
64,YOU WILL FIND ME CONTINUALLY SPEAKING OF FOUR MEN TITION HOLBEIN TURNER AND TO CUT UP AND ALMOST THE SAME TERMS
65,DID YOU NIGHT EVERY QUALITY AND SOMETIMES YOU WILL FIND YOU REFRIENDED THEM AS COHERENTS SOMETIMES AS KUREASURISTS
66,BY BEING SERIOUS OF COLOR THEY ARE STUDIOUS OF DIVISION AND WHILE THE KURASGURIS DEVELOPEDS HIMSELF TO THE REPRESENTATION OF DEGREES OF FORCE AND ONE THING ON SEPARATED LIGHT A COLOURISTS HAVE FOR THEIR FUNCTION THE ATTAINMENT OF BEAUTY BY ARRANGEMENT OF THE PROVISIONS OF LIGHT
67,MY FIRST AND PRINCIPAL REASON WAS THAT THEY ENFORCED BEYOND ALL RESISTANCE ON ANY STUDENT WHO MIGHT ATTEMPT TO COPY THEM THIS METHOD OF LAYING PORTIONS OF DISTINCT HUGH SIDE BY SIDE
68,SOME OF THE TOUCHES INDEED WHEN THE TINT HAS BEEN MIXED WITH MUCH WATER HAVE BEEN LAID IN LITTLE DROPS OR PONDS SO THAT THE PAVEMENT MIGHT CRYSTALLIZE HARD AT THE EDGE
69,JUST THE HEAD OF A PARROT WITH A LITTLE FLOUR IN HIS BEAK FROM A PICTURE OF CARBONIUS ONE OF HIS SERIES OF THE LIFE OF SAINT GEORGE
70,THEN HE COMES TO THE BEAT OF IT
71,THE BROWN GROUND BENEATH IS LEFT FOR THE MOST PART ONE TOUCH A BLACK IS PUT FOR THE HOLLOW TWO DELICATE LINES OF DARK GRAY TO FIND THE OUTER CURVE AND ONE LITTLE QUIVERING TOUCH OF WHITE DROWSY IN HER EDGE OF THE MANABLE
72,FOR BELIEVE ME THE FINAL FLASKI OF ART CAN ONLY GRATIFY THEIR OPINION THAT THE BEAUTY OF A COCROBEN IS TO BE READ AND OF A GRASS PLOT TO BE GREEN AND THE BEST SKILL OF ART IS AN INSTANTLY SEIZING ON THE MANIFOLD DELICIOUSNESS OF LIGHT WHICH YOU CAN ONLY SEES BY PRECISION OF LIGHT WHICH YOU CAN ONLY SEES BY PRECISION OF LIGHT WHICH YOU CAN ONLY SEES BY PRECISION OF LIGHT WHICH YOU CAN ONLY SEES BY PRECISION OF LIGHT WHICH YOU CAN ONLY SEES BY PRECISION OF LIGHT WHICH YOU CAN ONLY SEES BY PRECISION OF LIGHT WHICH YOU CAN ONLY
73,NOW YOU WILL SEE IN THESE STUDIES THAT THE MOMENT THE WHITE IS ENCLOSED PROPERLY AND HARMONIZED WITH THE OTHER HEIS IT BECOMES SOMEHOW MORE PRECIOUS AND PEARLY THAN THE WHITE PAPER AND THAT I AM NOT AFRAID TO LEAVE A WHOLE FIELD OF UNTRATED WHITE PAPER ALL ROUND IT BEING SURE THAT EVEN THE LITTLE DIAMONDS IN THE LITTLE DIAMONDS AND THE LITTLE DIAMONDS AND THE LITTLE DIAMONDS AND THE LITTLE DIAMONDS AND THE LITTLE DIAMONDS AND THE ROUND IT
74,BUT IN THIS THING YET COPIED FROM TURNER YOU HAVE THE TWO PRINCIPLES BROUGHT OUT PERFECTLY
75,THEY ARE BEYOND ALL OTHER WORKS THAN I KNOW EXISTING DEPENDED FOR THEIR EFFECT ON LOW SUBDUED TONES THEIR FAVOR CHOICE IN TIME OF DAY BEING EITHER DAWN OR TWILIGHT AND EVEN THEIR BRIGHTEST SUN SETS PRODUCED CHIEFLY OUT OF GREAT PAPER
76,IT MAY BE THAT A GREAT COLORLESS WILL USE HIS UTMOST FORCE OF COLOR AS A SINGER HIS FULL POWER OF VOICE BUT LOUD OR LOW THE VIRTUES IN BOTH CASES ALWAYS INTERFINEMENT NEVER IN LAMENESS
77,IT MUST REMEMBER BE ONE OR THE OTHER
78,DO NOT THEREFORE THINK THAT THE GOTHIC SCHOOLS IN EASY ONE
79,THE LAW OF THAT SCHOOLS THAT EVERYTHING SHALL BE SEEN CLEARLY OR AT LEAST ONLY IN SUCH MISTER FAINTNESS AS SHALL BE DELIGHTFUL AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE BEST INTRODUCTION TO IT WOULD BE THE ELEMENTARY PRACTICE OF PAINTING EVERY STUDY ON A GOLDEN GROUND
80,THIS AT ONCE COMPOSE YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WORK IS TO BE IMAGINATIVE AND DEGRRATIVE THAT IT REPRESENTS BEAUTIFUL THINGS IN THE CLEAREST WAY BUT NOT UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS AND THAT IN FACT YOUR PRODUCING JEWELLERS WERE RATHER THAN PICTURES
81,AT A STYLES RESTRAINED OR SEVERE DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT IS ALSO ERRONEOUS
82,IN ALL EARLY GOTHIC ART INDEED YOU WILL FIND FAILURE OF THIS KIND ESPECIALLY DISTORTION AND RIGIDITY WHICH ARE IN MANY RESPECT PAINFULLY TO BE COMPARED WITH THE SPLENDID REPOSE OF CLASSIC ART
83,THE LARGE LETTER CONTAINS INDEED ENTIRELY FEEBLE AND ILL DRAWN FIGURES THAT IS MERELY CHILDISH AND FAILING WORK OF AN A FEAR HAND IT IS NOT CHARACTERISTIC OF GOTHIC OR ANY OTHER SCHOOL
84,BUT OBSERVED EQUALLY DO THIS ON ONE CONDITION THAT OF STRIDING ALSO TO CREATE IN REALITY THE BEAUTY WHICH YOU SEEK IN IMAGINATION
85,IT WILL BE WHOLLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO RETAIN THE TRANQUILLITY OF TEMPER AND FOOLISHITY OF FAITH NECESSARY FROM NOBLE PUREST PAINTING UNLESS YOU ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN PROMOTING THE FULLESTIAN PEACE OF PRACTICAL LIFE
86,YOU MUST LOOK AT HIM IN THE FACE FIGHT HIM COPPER HIM WITH WHAT GRAVE YOU MAY YOU NEED NOT THINK TO KEEP OUT AT THE WAY OF HIM
87,THE COLONISTS SAYS FIRST OF ALL AS MY DELICIOUS PARCHAY WAS RUBY SO THIS NESTY VIBBER SHALL BE BLACK AND THEN IS THE QUESTION CAN I ROUND HIM OFF EVEN THOUGH HE IS BLACK AND MAKE HIM SWIMY AND YET SPRINGY AND CLOSE DOWN CLOWNY AND YET SPRINGY AND CLOSE DOWN
88,NOTHING WILL BE MORE PRECIOUS TO YOU I THINK IN THE PRACTICAL STUDY OF ART THAN THE CONVICTION WHICH WILL FORCE ITSELF ON YOU MORE EVERY HOUR OF THE WAY ALL THINGS ARE DOWN TOGETHER LITTLE AND GREAT AND SPIRIT AND A MATTER
89,YOU KNOW I HAVE JUST BEEN TELLING YOU HAVE THE SCHOOL MATERIALISM IN CLAY INVOLVED ITSELF AT LAST AND CLOUD AND FIRE
90,HERE IS AN EQUALLY TYPICAL GREEK SCHOOL LANDSCAPE BY WILSON LOST WHOLLY IN GOLD NEST THE TREES SO SLIGHTLY DRAWN THAT YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE TREES OR TOWERS AND NO CARE FOR COLOR WHATSOEVER PERFECTLY DECEPTIVE IN MARVELOUS EFFECT OF SUNSHINE THROUGH THE MIST A POLICY
91,NOW HERE IS ROUGH IOW EXACTLY BETWEEN THE TWO TREES STILL DRAWN LEAF BY LEAF WHOLLY FORMAL BUT BEAUTIFUL MIST COME GRADUALLY INTO THE DISTANCE
92,WHILE THEN LAST HERE IS TERRORS GREAT SCHOOL OF THE HIGHEST CLASS AND HE DEFINE HIS ART ABSOLUTELY AS FIRST THE DISPLAYING INTENSELY AND WITH THE STERNEST INTELLECT OF NATURAL FORM AS IT IS AND THEN THE ENVELOPMENT OF IT WITH CLOUD AND FIRE
93,ONLY THERE ARE TWO SORTS OF CLOUD AND FIRE
94,HE KNOWS THEM BOTH
95,THERE IS ONE AND THERE'S ANOTHER THE DEADLY AND THE FLINT
96,IT IS ONLY A CONSEIL OUTLINED BY EDWARD BURNED GEMS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE STORY OF PSYCHE IT IS THE INTRODUCTION OF PSYCHE AFTER ALL HER TROUBLES INTO HEAVEN
97,EVERY PLAN IN THE GRASS IS SET FORMERLY GROWS PERFECTLY AND MAYBE REALISED COMPLETELY
98,EXCLUSE IT ORDER AND UNIVERSAL WITH THE TUNNEL LIFE AND LIGHT THIS IS THE FAITH AND EFFORT OF THE SCHOOLS OF CRISTEL AND YOU MAY DESCRIBE AND COMPLETE THEIR WORK QUITE LITERALLY BY TAKING ANY VERSES OF TROUSERS AND HIS TENDER MOOD AND OBSERVING HOW HE INSISTS ON THE CLEARNESS AND BRIGHTNESS AND BRIGHTNESS AND BRIGHTNESS AND BRIGHTNESS AND BRIGHTNESS AND BRIGHTNESS FIRST AND BRIGHTNESS FIRST AND BRIGHTNESS FIRST AND BRIGHTNESS FIRST AND THEN ON THE CLEARNESS FIRST AND THEN ON THE CLEARNESS FIRST AND THEN ON THE CLEARNESS AND BRIGHTNESS AND BRIGHTNESS AND BRIGHTNESS FIRST AND BRIGHTNESS FIRST
99,THUS IN TROUSERS DREAM
100,IN BOTH THESE HIGH MYTHICAL SUBJECTS THE SURROUNDING NATURE DOES SUFFERING IS STILL DIGNIFIED AND BEAUTIFUL
101,EVERY LINE IN WHICH THE MASTER TRACES IT EVEN WERE SEEMINGLY NEGLIGION IS LOVELY AND SET DOWN WITH A MEDITATE OF CALMNESS WHICH MAKES THESE TWO ATINGS CAPABLE OF BEING PLACED BESIDE THE MUCH TRANQUIL WORK OF WHOLE BIND OR GURE
102,BUT NOW HERE IS A SUBJECT OF WHICH YOU WILL WONDER AT FIRST WHY TURNER DREW IT AT ALL
103,IT HAS NO BEAUTY WHATSOEVER NO SPECIALTY OF PICTURESQUENESS AND ALL ITS LINES ARE CRAMPED AND POOR
104,THE CRAMPNESS IN THE POVERTY ARE ALL INTENDED
105,IT IS A GLEAMER BRAIN DOWN HER ONE'S CHIEF OF CORN TO AN OLD WATER MILL IT'S SELF MOSSY AND RENT SCARCELY ABLE TO GET IT STANDS TO TIME
106,TO SEE IS ABSOLUTELY ARCHADIAN
107,SEE THAT YOUR LIES BE IN NOTHING WORSE THAN A BOY'S CRYING FOR HIS ENTANGLED HEIGHT
108,IT WILL BE WELL FOR YOU YOU JOIN NOT WITH THOSE WHO INSTEAD OF KNIGHTS FLY FOUNTAINS INSTEAD OF OBEYING THE LAST WORDS OF THE GREAT CLOUD SHEPHERD TO FEED HIS SHEEP LIVE THE LIVES HOW MUCH LESS THAN VANITY OF THE WAR WOLF IN THE GEARIABLE
109,ALSO A POPULAR AND DRIVENS WHEREBY LOVE MAKING MAY BE SUSPENDED BUT NOT STOPPED DURING THE TICKET SEASON
110,HARANG THE TIRESOME PRODUCT OF A TIRELESS TONGUE
111,AND DOOR CAME PAINFUL TO HEAR
112,HAIRY FEVER A HEART TROUBLE CAUSED BY FALLING IN LOVE WITH A GRASS WIDOW
113,HAVING A GOOD PLACE TO BE RAISED TOO
114, HEDGE A FENCE
115,HARADITY THE CAUSE OF ALL OUR FAULTS
116,HARS SENSE A DEGREE OF WISDOM THAT KEEPS ONE FROM BETTING ON THE RACES
117,HOW'S MAN'S EXCUSE FOR WAKING THE WALK
118,HOW TOO A PLACE WHERE A GUEST OFTEN GIVES UP GOOD DAWAS FOR POOR QUARTERS
119,HOW SCREAMING A DOMESTIC UP FEEBLE LET MAKES IT EASY FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO ENLIST ALL THE SOLDIERS IT NEEDS
120,HAS BEEN THE NEXT THING TO A WIFE
121,HSA WOMAN AND BON TIE
122, TIED TO A WOMAN
123,HAPP A GRIN A HORSE STEER THERE
124,THOSE PRETTY WRONGS THAT LITTER HE COMMITS WHEN I AM SOME TIME ABSENT FROM THY HEART THY BEAUTY AND THY YEARS FULL WELL DEFENCE FOR STILL TEMPTATION FOLLOWS WHERE THOU ART
125,I ME
126,NO MATTER THEN ALTHOUGH MY FLITTED STAND UPON THE FAREST EARTH REMOVED FROM THEE FOR NIMBLE THOUGHT CAN JUMP BOTH THE AND LAND AS SOON AS THINK THE PLACE WHERE HE WOULD BE BUT ARE
127,THOUGHT KILLS ME THAT I AM NOT THOUGHT TO LEAD LARGE LINKS OF MILES WHEN THOU ART GONE BUT THAT SO MUCH OF EARTH AND WATER WROUGHT I MUST A TEND TIMES MEASURE WITH MY MOON RECEIVING NOT BY ELEMENT SO SLOW
128,MY HEART OFF PLEAD THAT THOU IN HIM DOTH LIE A CLOSET NEVER PIERCED WITH CRISTEL EYES BUT THE DEFENDING DOTH THAT LEADEN EYE AND SAYS IN HIM THY FAIR APPEARANCE LIES
129,YOU ARE MY ALL THE WORLD AND I MUST STRIVE TO KNOW MY CHAINS AND PRAISES FROM YOUR TONGUE NONE ELSE TO ME NOR I TO NONE ALIVE BUT MY SEALED AND OR CHANGES RIGHT OR WRONG
130,OH TIS THE FIRST TIS FLATTERY IN MY SCENE AND MY GREAT MIND MOST KINGLY DRINKS IT UP MINE I WELL KNOWS WHAT WITH HIS GUST IS GREEN AND TO HIS PALLIDDOTH PREPARE THE CUP IF IT BE POISONED TIS THE LESSER SIN THAT CUP IF IT BE POYSENED
131,BUT RECKONING TIME WHOSE MILLION ACCIDENTS CREEP IN TWITCHED OF OURS AND CHAINS DECREES OF KINGS TEN'S SACRED BEAUTY BLUNDED THE SHOPEST INTENSE DIVERSE JOHN MINDS TO THE COURSE OF ALTERING THINGS ALAS WHY FEARING OF TIME'S TYRANNY ALAS
132,LOVE IS A BABE THEN MIGHT I NOT SAY SO TO GIVE THY GROVE TO THAT WHICH DO DOTH GROW
133,SO I RETURNED REBUKE TO MY CONTENT AND GAIN BY ILL THROUGH I MORE THAN I HAVE SPENT
134,IT WAS THIS OBSERVATION THAT DREW FROM DOUGLAS AND NOT IMMEDIATELY BUT LATER IN THE EVENING OF REPLY THAT HAD THE INTERESTING CONSEQUENCE TO WHICH I CALL ATTENTION
135,SOME ONE ELSE TOLD US DURING NOT PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE WHICH I SAW HE WAS NOT FOLLOWING
136,CRIED ONE OF THE WOMEN HE TOOK NO NOTICE OF HER HE LOOKED AT ME BUT AS IF IN STEADILY HE SAW WHAT HE SPOKE OF
137,THERE WAS A UNANIMOUS GROAN AT THIS AND MUCH REPROACH AFTER WHICH IN HIS PRE OCCUPIED WAY HE EXPLAINED
138,THE STORIES WRITTEN
139,I GREW A RIGHT TO MY MAN AND CLOSED THE KEY HE COULD SEND DOWN THE PACKET AS HE FINDS IT
140,THE OTHERS RESENTED THIS MOMENT BUT IT WAS JUST SCRUPLES THE CHARMED ME
141,TO THIS HIS ANSWER WAS PROMPT HOPE FAINT GOD NOW AND IS THE WICKED YOURS
142,HE HUNG A FIRE AGAIN A WOMAN'S
143,SHE HAS BEEN DEAD THESE TWENTY YEARS
144,SHE SENT ME THE PAGES IN QUESTION BEFORE SHE DIED
145,SHE WAS THE MOST AGREEABLE WOMAN I EVER KNOWN IN HER POSITION SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTHY OF ANY WHATEVER
146,GARSON SIMPLY THAT SHE SAID SO BUT THAT I KNEW SHE HADN'T I WAS SURE I COULD SEE
147,REL EASILY JUDGE WHY WHEN YOU HEAR BECAUSE THE THING HAD BEEN SUCH A SCARE HE CONTINUED TO FIX ME
148,YOU ARE ACUTE
149,HE QUITTED THE FIRE AND DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
150,PROBABLY NOT TILL THE SECOND POST
151,IT WAS ALMOST THE TONE OF HOPE EVERYBODY WILL STAY
152,CRIED THE LADIES WHOSE DEPARTURE HAD BEEN FIXED
153,MISSUS GRIM HOWEVER EXPRESSED THE NEED FOR LITTLE MORE LIGHT
154,WHO WAS IT SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH THIS STORY WILL TELL I TOOK UPON MYSELF TO REPLY OH I CONWAY TO THE STORY THE STORY WON'T TELL SAID DOUGLAS NOT IN ANY LITTLE VULGAR WAY MORE'S THE PITY THEM
155,DON'T YOU TELL DOUBTLESS
156,FOR IF I DON'T KNOW WHO SHE WAS IN LOVE IT I KNOW WHO SHE WAS
157,LET ME SAY HERE DISTINCTLY TO HAVE DONE WITH IT THAT THIS NARRATIVE FROM AN EXACT TRANSCRIPT OF MY OWN MADE MUCH LATER AS WHAT I SHALL PRESENTLY GIVE
158,POOR DOUGLAS BEFORE HIS DEATH WHEN IT WAS IN SIGHT COMMITTED TO ME THE MANUSCRIPT THAT REACHED HIM ON THE THIRD OF THESE DAYS AND THAT ON THE SAME SPOT WITH IMMENSE EFFECT HE BEGAN TO READ TO OUR HUSH LITTLE CIRCLE ON THE NIGHT OF THE FOURTH
159,THE DEPARTING LADIES WHO HAD SAID THEY WOULD STAY DIDN'T OF COURSE THANK HEAVEN STUDY THEY DEPARTED IN CONSEQUENCE OF ARRANGEMENTS MADE IN A RANGE OF CURIOSITY AS THEY PROFESSED PRODUCED BY THE TOUCHES WITH WHICH HE HAD ALREADY WORKED HIS OUT
160,THE FIRST OF THESE SUCH AS CONVEYED THAT THE WRITTEN STATEMENT TOOK UP THE TAIL AT A POINT AFTER IT HAD IN A MANNER BEGUN
161,HE HAD FOR HIS OWN TOWN RESIDENCE OF BIG HOUSE FILLED WITH THE SPOILS OF TRAVEL AND THE TROPHIES OF THE CHASE BUT IT WAS TO HIS COUNTRY HOME AN OLD FAMILY PLACE IN ESSEX THAT HE WISHED HER IMMEDIATELY TO PROCEED
162,THE AWKWARD THING WAS THAT THEY HAD PRACTICALLY NO OTHER RELATIONS AND THAT HIS OWN AFFAIRS TOOK A BALL HIS TIME
163,THEY WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE TO HELP BUT IF COURSE THE YOUNG LADY WHO SHOULD GO DOWN AS GOVERNESS WOULD BE IN SUPREME AUTHORITY
164,I DON'T AND DISSIPATE
165,SHE WAS YOUNG I'M TRIED NERVOUS IT WAS A VISION OF SERIOUS DUTIES AND LITTLE COMPANY FOR REALLY GREAT LONELYNESS
166,HE IS BUT THAT'S JUST THE BEAUTY OF HER PASSION
167,IT WAS THE BEAUTY OF IT
168,IT'S SOUNDED DULL IT'S SOUNDED STRANGE AND ALL THE MORE SO BECAUSE IT IS MAIN CONDITION WHICH WAS
169,SHE PROMISED TO DO THIS AND SHE MENTIONED TO ME THAT WHEN FOR A MOMENT DISBURDENED DELIGHTED HE HELD HER HAND THENKING HER FOR THE SACRIFICE SHE ALREADY FELT REWARDED
170,BUT IT WAS THAT ALL HEROIC ONE OF THE LADIES ASKED
171,HOW STRANGE IT SEEMED TO THE SAD WOMAN AS SHE WATCHED THE GROWTH AND THE BEAUTY THAT BECAME EVERY DAY MORE BRILLIANT AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT THROUGH ITS QUIVERING SUNSHINE OVER THE TINY FEATURES OF THIS CHILD
172,GOD AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE SIN WHICH MAN THUS PUNISHED HAD GIVEN HER A LOVELY CHILD WHOSE PLACE WAS ON THAT SAME DISHONORED BOSOM TO CONNECT HER PARROT FOR EVER WITH THE RACE AND DESCENT OF MORTALS AND TO BE FINALLY BLESSED SO IN HEAVEN
173,YET THESE THOUGHTS AFFECTED HAS TO PRAYING LESS WITH HOPE AND APPREHENSION
174,THE CHILD HAD A NATIVE GRACE WHICH DOES NOT INVARIABLY COEXIST'D WITH FAULTLESS BEAUTY IT'S A TIRE HOWEVER SIMPLE ALWAYS IMPRESSED THE BEHOLDER AS IF IT WERE THE VERY GUARD THAT PRECISELY BECAME IT BEST
175,THIS OUTWARD MUTABILITY INDICATED AND DID NOT MORE THAN FAIRLY EXPRESSED THE VARIOUS PROPERTIES OF HER IN HER LIFE
176,HESTER COULD ONLY ACCOUNT FOR THE CHILD'S CHARACTER AND EVEN THEN MOST VAGUELY AND IMPERFECTLY BY RECALLING WHAT SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN DURING THAT MOMENTOUS PERIOD WHILE PEARL WAS ABIDING HER SOUL FROM THE SPIRITUAL WORLD AND HER BODILY FRAME FROM ITS MATERIAL OF EARTH
177,THEY WERE NOW ILLUMINATED BY THE MORNING RADIANCE OF A YOUNG CHILD'S DISPOSITION BUT LATER IN THE DAY OF EARTHLY EXISTENCE MIGHT BE PERFECT OF THE STORM AND WHIRLWIND
178,CHESTER PRINT NEVERTHELESS THE LOVING MOTHER OF THIS ONE CHILD RAN LITTLE RISK OF AIRING ON THE SIDE OF UNDO SEVERITY
179,MINDFUL HOWEVER OF HER OWN ERRORS AND MISFORTUNES SHE EARLY SOUGHT TO IMPOSE A TENDER BUT STRICT CONTROL OVER THE INFANT IMMORTALITY THAT WAS COMMITTED TO HER CHARGE
180,AS TO ANY OTHER KIND OF DISCIPLINE WHETHER ADDRESSED TO HER MIND OR HEART LITTLE QUARREL MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE WITHIN ITS REACH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CAPRICE THAT ROLLED A MOMENT
181,IT WAS A LOOK SO INTELLIGENT YET INEXPLICABLE PERVERSE SOMETIMES SO MALICIOUS BUT GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A WILD FLOW OF SPIRITS THAT HESTER COULD NOT HAVE QUESTIONING AT SUCH MOMENTS WHETHER PEARL WAS A HUMAN CHILD
182,BEHOLDING IT ESTHER WAS CONSTRAINED TO RUSH TOWARDS THE CHILD TO PURSUE THE LITTLE OATH IN THE FLIGHT WHICH SHE INVARIABLY BEGAN TO SNATCH HER TO HER BOSOM WITH A CLOSE PRESSURE AND EARNEST KISSES NOT SO MUCH FROM OVERFLOWING LOVE AS TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT PEARL WAS LESSENED BLOOD AS TO ASSURE HERSELF
183,BROODING OVER ALL THESE MATTERS THE MOTHER FELT LIKE ONE WHO HAS EVOKED TO SPIRIT BUT BY SOME IRREGULARITY IN THE PROCESS OF CONJURATION HAS FAILED TO WIND THE MASTER WORD THUS SHOULD CONTROL THIS NEW AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE INTELLIGENCE
184,PROMWELL WAS A BORN OUTCAST OF THE INFANTILE WORLD
185,PERAL SAW AND GAZED INTENTLY BUT NEVER SOUGHT TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE
186,IF SPOKEN TOO SHE WOULD NOT SPEAK AGAIN
187,HESTERPRANE WENT ONE DAY TO THE MANSION OF GOVERNOR BELLING HIM WITH A PAIR OF GLOVES WHICH SHE HAD FRINGED AND EMBROIDERED TO HIS ORDER AND WHICH WERE TO BE WORN ON SOME GREAT OCCASION OF STATE BORE THOUGH THE CHANCES OF A POPULAR ELECTION HAD CAUSED THE SPLENDOUR RULER TO DESCEND A STEP OR TO DESCEND A STEP OR TO DESCEND A STEWART TO DESCEND A STEPER TO DESCEND A STEPPARD TO DESCEND A STEPPERT TO DESCEND A STEWART TO DESCEND A STEWART TO DESCEND A STEPPERT TO DESCEND A STEP OR THOUGH THE HIGHEST STATE BORE TO DESCEND A STEPPERT
188,ANOTHER AND FAR MORE IMPORTANT REASON THAN THE DELAVORY OF A PAIR OF EMBROIDERED GLOVES IMPELLED HESTER AT THIS TIME TO SEEK AN INTERVIEW WITH A PERSONAGE OF SO MUCH POWER AND ACTIVITY IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE SETTLEMENT
189,AT THAT EPOCH OF PRISTINE SIMPLICITY HOWEVER MATTERS OF EVEN SLIDER PUBLIC INTEREST AND OF FAR LESS INTUIT WEIGHT THAN THE WELFARE OF HESTER AND HER CHILD WERE STRANGELY MIXED UP WITH THE DELIBERATIONS OF LEGISLATORS AND ACTS OF STATE
190,THE PERIOD WAS HARDLY IF AT ALL OR ALLEYER THAN THAT OF OUR STORY WHEN A DISPUTE THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN A PIG NOT ONLY CAUSE A FEARS AND BITTER CONTEST IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OF THE COLONY BUT RESULTED IN AN IMPORTANT MODIFICATION OF THE FRENCH WORK ITSELF OF THE LEGISLATOR
191,WE HAVE SPOKEN OF PEARLS RICH AND LUXURIANT BEAUTY A BEAUTY THAT SHONE WITH DEEP AND VIVID TINTS A BRIGHT COMPLEXION EYES POSSESSING INTENSITY BOTH OF DEPTH AND GLOW AND HAIR ALREADY OF A DEEP GLOSSY BROWN AND WHICH IN AFTER YEARS WOULD BE NEARLY AKIN TO BLACK
192,IT WAS THE SCARLET LETTER IN HER OTHER FORM THE SCARLET LETTER ENDOWED WITH LIFE
193,THE MOTHER HERSELF AS IF THE RED IGNOMINY WERE SO DEEPLY SCORCHED INTO HER BRAIN THAT ALL HER CONCEPTIONS ASSUMED ITS FORM HAD CAREFULLY WROUGHT OUT THE CIVILITUDE MANY HOURS OF MORBID INGENUITY TO CREATE AN AN ANALOGOUS
194,BUT IN TRUTH COLONEL WAS THE ONE AS WELL AS THE OTHER AND ONLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IDENTITY HAD HESTER CONTRIVED SO PERFECTLY TO REPRESENT THE SCARLET LETTER IN HER APPEARANCE
195,COME THEREFORE AND LET A SLANG BUT AT THEM
196,BUT PEARL WHO WAS A DAUNT WAS CHILD AFTER FROWNING HER FOOT AND SHAKING HER LITTLE HAND WITH A VARIETY OF THREATENING GESTURES SUDDENLY MADE A RUSH AT THE KNOT OF HER ENEMIES AND PUT THEM ALL TO FLIGHT
197,SHE SCREAMED AND SHOUTED TO WITH A TERRIFIC VOLUME OF SOUND WHICH DOUBTLESS CAUSED THE HEARTS OF THE FUGITIVES TO QUAKE WITHIN THEM
198,IT WAS FURTHER DECORATED WITH STRANGE AND SEEMINGLY CAPITALISTIC FIGURES AND DIAGANS SUITABLE TO THE GREAT TASTE OF THE AGE WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN IN THE STACKCO WHEN NEWLY LAID ON AND HAD NOW GROWN HARD AND DOORABLE FOR THE ADMIRATION OF AFTER TIMES
199,THEY APPROACHED THE DOOR WHICH WAS OF AN ARCHED FORM AND FLANKED ON EACH SIDE BY A NARROW TOWER OR PROJECTION OF THE EDIFICE IN BOTH OF WHICH WERE MODEST WINDOWS THE WOODEN SHUTTERS TO CLOSE OVER THEM AT NEED
200,LIFTING THE IRON HAMOR THAT HUNG AT THE PORTAL HAS TO BRING GAVE A SUMMONS WHICH WAS ANSWERED BY ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BOND SERVANTS A FREE BORN ENGLISH MAN BUT NOW A SEVEN YEARS SLAVE
201,YE HIS HONORABLE WORSHIP IS WITHIN BUT HE HATH THEY GODLY MINISTER OR TO WITH HIM AND LIKEWISE ALLEGED
202,HE MAY NOT SEE HIS WORSHIPPED NOW
203,WITH MANY VARIATIONS SUGGESTED BY THE NATURE OF HIS BUILDING MATERIALS DIVERSITY OF CLIMATE AND A DIFFERENT MODE OF SOCIAL LIFE GOVERNOR BELLING HIM HAD PLANNED HIS NEW HABITATION AFTER THE RESIDENCES OF GENTLEMEN OF FAIRESTATE IN HIS NATIVE LAND
204,ON THE TABLE AND TOKEN THAT THE SENTIMENT OF OLD ENGLISH HOSPITALITY HAD NOT BEEN LEFT BEHIND STOOD A LARGE PETER TANGLED AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH HAD HESTER OR PEARL PEEPED INTO IT THEY MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE FROSTY REMNANT OF A RECENT DRAUGHT OF ALE
205,LITTLE PEARL WHO WAS AS GREATLY PLEASED WITH THE GLEAMING ARMOR AS SHE HAD BEEN WITH THE GLITTERING FRONTEST PIECE OF THE HOUSE SPENT SOME TIME LOOKING INTO THE POLISHED MIRROR OF THE BREAST PLATE
206,MOTHER CRIED SHE I SEE YOU HERE LUCK UP
207,AND TRUTH SHE SEEMED ABSOLUTELY HIDDEN BEHIND IT
208,COLL ACCORDINGLY RAN TO THE BOAT WINDOW AT THE FURTHER END OF THE HALL AND LOOKED ALONG THE VISTA OF A GARDEN WALK CARPETED WITH CLOSELY SHAVEN GRASS AND BLOATED WITH SOME RUDE AND IMMITOR ATTEMPT AT SHRUBVERY
209,BUT THE PROPRIETOR APPEARED ALREADY TO HAVE RELAXED AS HOPELESS THE EFFORT TO PERPETUATE ON THIS SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC IN A HARD SOIL AND AMID THE CLOSE STRUGGLE FOR SUBSISTENCE THE NATIVE ENGLISH TASTE FOR ORNAMENTAL GARDEN
210,THERE WERE A FEW ROAST BUSHES HOWEVER AN A NUMBER OF APPLE TREES PROBABLY THE DESCENDANTS OF THOSE PLANTED BY THE REVEREND MISTER BLACKSTONE THE FIRST SETTLER OF THE PENINSULA THAT HALF MYTHOLOGICAL PERSONAGE WHO RIDES THROUGH OUR EARLY ANIMALS SEATED ON THE BACK OF A BALL
211,PIRL SEEING THE ROSEBUSHES BEGAN TO CRY FOR OUR RED ROSE AND WOULD NOT BE SATISFIED
212,HE WORE BLUE SILK STOCKINGS BLOOMY PANTS WITH GOLD BUCKLES A BLUE RUFFLED WAIST AND A JACKET OF BRIGHT BLUE RATED WITH GOLD
213,HIS HAT HAD A PEAKED CROWN NEAR THE FLAT BRIM AND AROUND THE BRIM WAS A ROW OF TINY GOLDEN BELLS THAT TINKLED WHEN HE MOVED
214,INSTEAD OF SHOES THE OLD MAN WORE BOOTS WITH TURN OVER TOPS AND HIS BLUE CODE HAD WIDE COSTS OF GOLD BRAYED
215,FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD WISHED TO EXPLORE THE BEAUTIFUL LAND OF EYES IN WHICH THEY LIVED
216,WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE UNCIBLY LATCHED THE DOOR AND STARTED UP THE PATH
217,NO ONE WOULD DISTURB THEIR LITTLE HOUSE EVEN IF ANY ONE CAME SO FAR INTO THE THICK FOREST WHILE THEY WERE GONE
218,AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT SEPARATED THE COUNTRY OF THE MONCHONS FROM A COUNTRY OF THEULICANS THE PATH DIVIDED
219,HE KNEW IT WOULD TAKE THEM TO THE HOUSE OF THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN BUT WHO WAS THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBOUR
220,ALL THE MORNING THEY TRUDGED UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND AT NOON UNCON UDO SAT ON THE FALLEN TREE TRUNK AND ATE THE LAST OF THE BREAD WHICH THE OLD LUNCH IT HAD PLACED IN HIS POCKET
221,THEN THEY STARTED ON AGAIN AND TWO HOURS LATER CAME IN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE OF DOCTOR PIPPED
222,OKNOT AT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE AND A CHUBBY PLEASANT FACED WOMAN DRESSED ALL IN BLUE OPENED IT AND GREETED THE VISITORS WITH A SMILE
223,I AM MY DEAR AND ALL STRANGERS ARE WELCOME TO MY HOME
224,WE HAVE COME FROM A FIRE LONELY A PLACE IN THIS ALONE NEAR PLACE
225,AND YOU MUST BE OLDER ON LUCKY SHE ADDED
226,OH JOE HAD NEVER EATEN SUCH A FINE MEAL AND ALL HIS LIFE
227,WE ARE TRAVELLING REPLIED OH AND WE STOPPED THAT YOUR HOUSE JUST TO REST AND REFRESH OURSELVES
228,THE WOMAN SEEMED THOUGHTFUL
229,AT ONE END STOOD A GREAT FIREPLACE IN WHICH ARE BLUE LOG WAS BLAZING WITH A BLUE FLAME AND OVER THE FIRE HUNG FOUR CEDLES IN A ROW ALL BUBBLING AND STEAMING AT A GREAT RATE
230,IT TAKES ME SEVERAL YEARS TO MAKE THIS MAGIC POWDER BUT IT THIS MOMENT I AM LEIF TO SAY IT IS NEARLY DONE YOU SEE I AM MAKING IT FOR MY GOOD WIFE MORE GOAT THE ONES TO USE SOME OF IT FOR A PURPOSE OF HER OWN
231,YOU MUST KNOW SAID MARGUERITE WHEN THEY WERE ALL SEATED TOGETHER ON THE BROAD WINDOW SEAT BUT MY HUSBAND FOOLISHLY GAVE AWAY ALL THE POWDER OF LIFE HE FIRST MADE TO OLD MAUMEE THE WHICH WHO USED TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY OF THE DILIGENCE TO THE NORTH OF HERE
232,THE FIRST LOT WE TESTED ON OUR GLASS HAT WHICH NOT ONLY BEGAN TO LIVE BUT HAS LIVED EVER SINCE
233,I THINK THE NEXT GLASS HALF THE MAGICIAN MAKES WILL HAVE NEITHER BRAINS NOR HEART FOR THEN IT WILL NOT OBJECT TO CATCHING MICE AND MAY PROVE OF SOME USE TO US
234,I'M AFRAID I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ABOUT THE LAND TO LIES
235,YOU SEE I HAVE LIVED DOWN MY LIFE WITHOUT LOKI THE SILENT ONE AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO TELL ME ANYTHING
236,THAT IS ONE REASON KNEW OR OHIO THE UNLUCKY SAID THE WOMAN IN SYMPATHETIC TONE
237,I THINK I MUST SHOW YOU MY PATCHWORD GIRL SAID MARGARET LAUGHING AT THE BOY'S ASTONISHMENT AND SHE IS RATHER DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN
238,BUT FIRST I WILL TELL YOU THAT FOR MANY YEARS I HAVE LONGED FOR A SERVANT TO HELP ME WITH THE HOUSE WORK AND TO GO THROUGH MEALS AND WASH THE DISHES
239,YET THAT TASK WAS NOT SO EASY AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE
240,A BED QUILT MADE OF PATCHES OF DIFFERENT KINDS AND COLORS OF CLOTH ONLY SO TOGETHER
241,SOMETIMES IT IS CALLED A CRAZY QUILT BECAUSE THE PATCHES AND COLORS ARE SO MIXED UP
242,WHEN I FOUND IT I SAID TO MYSELF THAT IT WOULD DO NICELY FOR MY SERVANT GIRL FOR WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT TO LIFE SHE WOULD NOT BE PROUD NOR HAUGHTY AS THE GLASS CAT IS FOR SUCH A DREADFUL MIXTURE OF COLORS WOULD DISCERRED HER FROM TIME TO BE AS DIGNIFIED AS THE BLUE MONTHS GAINS ARE
243,AT THE EMERALD CITY WHERE OUR PRINCESS OSBORNE AS A POPULAR COLOR
244,I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT A GOOD JOB I DID AND SHE WENT TO IT ALL COVERED AND THREW OPEN THE DOORS
245,OH YOU EXAMINE THIS CURIOUS CONTRIVANCE WITH WONDER
246,LARGEILLOT HAD FIRST MADE THE GIRL'S FORM FROM THE PATCHWARK WHEELED AND THEN SHE HAD DRESSED IT WITH A PATCHWARK AND AN APRON WITH POCKETS IN IT USING THE SAME DAY MATERIAL THREW OUT
247,THE HEAD OF THE BACHELOR GIRL WAS THE MOST CURIOUS PART OF HER
248,THE HAIR WAS OF BROWN YARN AND HUNG DOWN ON HER NECK AND SEVERAL NEAT BRAIDS
249, GOLD IS THE MOST COMMON MEDDLE IN THE LAND OF OURS AND IS USED FOR MANY PURPOSES BECAUSE THE DIS SOFT AND PLAYABLE
250,NO WIFE FORGOT ABOUT AND BRAINS EXCLAIMED THE WOMAN
251,WELL THAT MAY BE TRUE AGREED MARGUERITE BUT ON THE CONTRARY A SERVANT WITH TOO MUCH BRAINS ARE SURE TO BECOME INDEPENDENT AND HIGH AND MIGHTY AND FEEL ABOVE HER WORK
252,SHE POURED INTO THE DISTRICT QUANTITY FROM EACH OF THESE BOTTLES
253,I THINK THAT WILL DO SHE CONTINUED FOR THE OTHER QUALITIES ARE NOT NEEDED IN A SERVANT
254,SHE RAN TO HER HUSBAND'S SIDE AT ONCE AND HELPED HIM LIFT THE FOUR CAILS FROM THE FIRE
255,THEIR CONTENTS HAD ALL BOILED AWAY LEAVING IN THE BOTTOM OF EACH CATTLE A FEW GRAINS OF FINE WHITE POWDER
256,VERY CAREFULLY THE MAGICIAN REMOVED THIS POWDER PLACING IT ALTOGETHER IN A GOLDEN DISH WHERE HE MIXED IT WITH A GOLDEN SPOON
257,NO ONE SAW HIM DO THIS FOR ALL WERE LOOKING AT THE POWDER OF LIFE BUT SOON THE WOMAN REMEMBERED WHAT SHE HAD BEEN DOING AND CAME BACK TO THE CUPBOARD
258,OTO BECAME A BIT UNEASY AT THIS FOR HE HAD ALREADY PUT QUITE A LOT OF THE CLEVERNESS POUTER IN THE DISH BUT HE DARED NOT INTER FEAR AND SO HE COMFORTED HIMSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT ONE CANNOT HAVE TOO MUCH CLEVERNESS
259,HE SELECTED A SMALL GOLD BOTTLE WITH THE PEPPER BOX TOP SO THAT THE POWDER MIGHT BE SPRINKLED ON ANY OBJECT THROUGH THE SMALL HOLES
260,MOST PEOPLE TAUGHT TOO MUCH SO IT IS A RELIEF TO FIND ONE WHO TALKS TOO LITTLE
261,I AM NOT ALLOWED BEFORE MAGIC EXCEPT FOR MY OWN AMUSEMENT HE TOLD HIS VISITORS AS HE LIGHTED A PIPE WITH A CROOKED STEM AND BEGAN TO SMOKE
262,THERE IS IT OF LAWS WHO USED TO BE A HUMBUG AND KNEW NO MAGIC AT ALL HAS BEEN TAKING LESSONS OF GLINDA AND UNTOLD HE IS GETTING TO BE A PRETTY GOOD WIZARD BUT HE IS NEARLY THE ASSISTANT OF THE GREAT SORORS
263,IT TRULY IS ASSERTED THE MAGICIAN
264,I KNOW USE THEM AS ORDINARILY IN MY GARDEN
265,DEAR ME ONE OF CHANTER BOX ARE GETTING TO BE ON REMARKED THE MAGICIAN WHO WAS PLEASED WITH THE COMPLIMENT
266,ASKED THE VOICE IN SCORNFUL ABSENCE
267,THE GRATEFUL APPLAUSE OF THE CLERGY HAS CONSECRATED THE MEMORY OF A PRINCE WHO INDULGED THEIR PASSIONS AND PROMOTED THEIR INTEREST
268,THE EDITH OF MILLAN THE GREAT CHARTER OF TOLERATION HAD CONFIRMED TO EACH INDIVIDUAL OF THE ROMAN WORLD THE PRIVILEGE OF CHOOSING AND PROFESSING HIS OWN RELIGION
269,BUT THESE INEESTIMABLE PRIVILEGE WERE SOON VIOLATED WITH A KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTH THE EMPEROR EMBOD THE MAXIMS OF PERSECUTION AND THE SEX WHICH DESCENDED FROM THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WERE AFFLICTED AND OPPRESSED BY THE TRIUMPH OF CHRISTIANITY
270,CONSTANTINE EASILY BELIEVED THAT THE HEREITICS WHO PRESUMED TO DISPUTE HIS OPINIONS OR GUILTY OF THE MOST ABSURD AND CRIMINAL OBSTINACY AND THAT A SEASONABLE APPLICATION OF MODERATE SEVERITIES MIGHT SAVE THOSE UNHAPPY MEN FROM THE DANGER OF AN EVERLASTING CONDEMNATION
271,SOME OF THE PENAL REGULATIONS WERE COPIED FROM THE EEDICS OF DILATION AND THIS METHOD OF CONVERSION WAS APPLAUDED BY THE SAME BISHOPS WHO HAD FELT THE HAND OF OPPRESSION AND PLEADED FOR THE RIGHTS OF HUMANITY
272,THEY ASSERTED WITH CONFIDENCE AND ALMOST WITH EXALTATION THAT THE APOSTALLICAL SUCCESSION WAS INTERRUPTED THAT ALL THE BISHOPS OF EUROPE AND ASIA WERE INFECTED BY THE CONTAGION OF GUILT AND SKILL AND THAT THE PARROGATIVES OF THE KATHIC CHURCH WERE CONFINED TO THE CHOSEN
273,BISHIPS VIRGINS AND EVEN SPOTLESS INFANTS WERE SUBJECTED TO THE DISGRACE OF A PUBLIC PENANCE BEFORE THEY COULD BE ADMITTED TO THE COMMUNION OF THE DOMITISTS
274,PSCRIBED BY THE CIVIL AND ECCLESIASTICAL POWERS OF THE EMPIRE THE DAUNTIST STILL MAINTAINED IN SOME PROVINCES PARTICULARLY INIMMEDIATE THEIR SUPERIOR NUMBERS AND FOUR HUNDRED BISHOPS ACKNOWLEDGED THE JURISDICTION OF THEIR PRIMEATE
275,SINCE THE PERIOD OF OUR TALE THE ACTIVE SPIRIT OF THE COUNTRY HAS SURROUNDED IT WITH A BELT OF RICH AND DRIVING SETTLEMENTS THOUGH NONE BUT THE HUNTER OR THE SAVAGE IS EVER KNOWN EVEN NOW TO PENETRATE ITS WILD RECESSES
276,THE JEWS WERE SUFFERED TO EXAIL AND THE SUN HAD DISPERSE'D THE MISTS AND WAS SHEDING A STRONG AND CLEAR LIGHT IN THE FOREST WHEN THE TRAVELLERS RESUMED THEIR JOURNEY
277,AFTER PROCEEDING A FEW MILES THE PROGRESS OF HOPET WHO LED THE ADVANCE BECAME MORE DELIBERATE AND WATCHFUL
278,HE OFTEN STOPPED TO EXAMINE THE TREES NOR DID HE CROSS A PRIVILEGE WITHOUT ATTENTIVELY CONSIDERING THE QUANTITY OF PHILOSOPHY AND THE COLOR OF ITS WATERS
279,DESTRESSING HIS OWN JUDGMENT HIS APPEALS TO THE OPINION OF SHINGATCH COOK WERE FREQUENT AND EARNEST
280,YET HERE WE WITHIN A SHORT RANGE OF THE SKIRONS AND NOT A SIGN OF A TRAIL HAVE WE CROSSED
281,LET US RETRICE OUR STEPS AND EXAMINED AS WE GO WITH KEENER EYES
282,CHANGING CATCHG HAD CAUGHT THE LOOK AND MOTIONING WITH HIS HAND HE BADE HIM SPEAK
283,THE EYES OF THE WHOLE PARTY FOLLOWED THE UNEXPECTED MOVEMENT AND READ THEIR SUCCESS IN THE AIR OF TRIUMPH THAT THE YOUTH ASSUMED
284,IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE WONDERFUL HEAVY SPOKEN WITHOUT A BIDDING
285,SEE SAID UNCAS POINTING NORTH AND SOUTH AT THE EVIDENT MARKS OF THE BROAD TRAIL ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM THE DARK CARE HAS GONE TOWARD THE FOREST
286,IF A ROCK OR RIVULETS OR BIT OF US HARDER THAN COMMON SEVERED THE LINKS OF THE CREW THEY FOLLOWED THE TRUE I OF THE SCOUT RECOVERED THEM AT A DISTANCE AND SELDOM RENDERED THE DELAY OF A SINGLE MOMENT NECESSARY
287,EXTINGUISHED BRANDS WERE LYING AROUND A SPRING THE AWFULS OF A DEER WERE SCATTERED ABOUT THE PLACE AND THE TREES BORE EVIDENT MARKS OF HAVING BEEN ROUSED BY THE HORSES
288,A CIRCLE OF A FEW HUNDRED FEET IN CIRCUMFERENCE WAS DRAWN AND EACH OF THE PARTY TOOK A SACRED FOR HIS PORTION
289,THE EXAMINATION HOWEVER RESULTED IN NO DISCOVERY
290,THE WHOLE PARTY CROWDED TO THE SPOT WERE ANTICIPATED OUT THE IMPRESSION OF A MOCCASAN IN THE VOICE ALLUSION
291,RUN BACK UNCAS AND BRING ME THE SIZE OF THE SINGERS FOOT
292,NOTWITHSTANDING THE HIGH RESOLUTION OF HOPET HE FULLY COMPREHENDED ALL THE DIFFICULTIES AND DANGER HE WAS ABOUT TO INCUR
293,IN HIS RETURN TO THE CAMP HIS ACUTE AND PRACTISED INTO LEX WERE INTENTLY ENGAGED IN DEVISING MEANS TO COUNTERACT A WATCHFULNESS AND SUSPICION ON THE PART OF HIS ENEMIES THAT HE KNEW WERE IN NO DEGREE IN FEAR TO HIS OWN
294,IN OTHER WORDS WHILE HE HAD IMPLICIT FAITH IN THE ABILITY OF BEAM'S ASKED TO SPEAK HE WAS SOMEWHAT SKEPTICAL ON THE SUBJECT OF A BARE'S SINGING AND YET HE HAD BEEN ASSURED OF THE LATTER ON THE TESTIMONY OF HIS OWN EXQUISITE ORGANS
295,THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS AIR IN THE MANNER THAT BETRAYED TO THE SCOUT THE UTTER CONFUSION OF THE STATE OF HIS MIND
296,THE INGENIOUS HOPIE WHO RECALLED THE HASTY MANNER IN WHICH THE OTHER HAD ABANDONED HIS POST AT THE BED SIDE OF THE SICK WOMAN WAS NOT WITHOUT HIS SUSPICIONS CONCERNING THE SUBJECT OF SO MUCH SOLEMN DELIBERATION
297,THE BEAR SHOOK HIS SHAGGY SIDES AND THEN A WELL KNOWN VOICE REPLIED
298,CAN THESE THINGS BE RETURNED DAVID BREATHING MORE FREELY AS THE TRUTH BEGAN TO DAWN UPON HIM
299,COME COME RETURNEDHOCKY AND KISSING HIS HONEST COUNTENANCE THE BETTER TO ASSURE THE WAVERING CONFIDENCE OF HIS COMPANION YOU MAY SEE A SKIN WHICH IF IT BE NOT AS WHITE AS ONE OF THE GENTLE ONES HAS NO TINGE OF RED TO IT THAT THE WINDS OF THE HEAVEN AND THE SUN HAVE NOT BESTOWED NOW LET US TO BUSINESS
300,THE YOUNG MAN IS IN BONDAGE AND MUCH I FEAR HIS DEATH IS DECREED
301,I GREATLY MORE THAT ONE SO WELL DISPOSED SHOULD DIE IN HIS IGNORANCE AND I HAVE SOUGHT A GOODLY HIM CAN YOU LEAVE ME TO HIM
302,THE TASK WILL NOT BE DIFFICULT RETURNED DAVID HESITATING THOUGH I GREATLY FEAR YOUR PRESENCE WOULD RATHER INCREASE THAN MITIGATE HIS UNHAPPY FORTUNES
303,THE LODGE IN WHICH UNCAS WAS CONFINED WAS IN THE VERY CENTRE OF THE VILLAGE AND IN A SITUATION PERHAPS MORE DIFFICULT THAN ANY OTHER TO APPROACH OR LEAVE WITHOUT OBSERVATION
304,FOR A FIVE OF THE LATTER ONLY LINGERED ABOUT THE DOOR OF THE PRISON OF UNCAS WARY BUT CLOSE OBSERVERS OF THE MANNER OF THEIR CAPTIVE
305,DELIVERED IN A STRONG TONE OF ASSENT ANNOUNCED THE GRATIFICATION THE SAVAGE WOULD RECEIVE IN WITNESSING SUCH AN EXHIBITION OF WEAKNESS IN AN ENEMY SO LONG HATED AND SO MUCH FEARED
306,THEY DREW BACK A LITTLE FROM THE ENTRANCE AND MOTION TO THE SUPPOSED OF CONJURE TO ENTER
307,BUT THE BEAR INSTEAD OF O BANG MAINTAINED THE SEAT IT HAD TAKEN AND GROWLED
308,THE CUNNING MAN AS AFRAID THAT HIS BREATH WILL BLOW UPON HIS BROTHERS AND TAKE AWAY THEIR COURAGE TO CONTINUED DAVID AND PROVING THE HAND HE RECEIVED THEY MUST STAND FURTHER OFF
309,THEN AS A SATISFIED OF THEIR SAFETY THE SCOUT LEFT HIS POSITION AND SLOWLY ENTERED THE PLACE
310,IT WAS SILENT AND GLOOMY BEING TENANTED SOLELY BY THE CAPTIVE AND LIGHTED BY THE DYING EMBERS OF A FIRE WHICH HAD BEEN USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF COOKERY
311,ON THIS OCCUPIED A DISTANT CORNER IN A DECLINING ATTITUDE BEING RIGIDLY BOUND BOTH HANDS IN FEET BY STRONG AND PAINFUL WITS
312,THE SCOUT WHO HAD LEFT DAVID AT THE DOOR TO ASCERTAIN THEY WERE NOT OBSERVED THOUGHT IT PRUDENT TO PRESERVE HIS DISGUISE UNTIL ASSURED OF THEIR PRIVACY
313,WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH THE WINDOWS AT THE DOOR THEY COUNT SIX AND THE SINGERS AS GOOD AS NOTHING
314,THE DELAWARES ARE CHILDREN OF THE TORTOISE AND THEY OUTSTRIPPED THE DEER
315,UNCUS WHO HAD ALREADY APPROACHED THE DOOR AND READINESS TO LEAD THE WAY NOW RECOILED AND PLACED HIMSELF ONCE MORE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE LODGE
316,BUT HACK I WHO WAS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED WITH HIS OWN THOUGHTS TO NOTE THE MOVEMENT CONTINUED SPEAKING MORE TO HIMSELF INTO HIS COMPANION
317,SO UNCAS YOU HAD BETTER TAKE THE LEAD WHILE I WILL PUT ON THE SKIN AGAIN AND TRUST TO CUNNING FOR WANT OF SPEED
318,WELL WHAT CAN'T BE DONE BY MAIN COURAGE AND WAR MUST BE DONE BY CIRCUMVENTION
319,AS SOON AS THESE DISPOSITIONS WERE MADE THE SCOUT TURNED TO DAVID AND GAVE HIM AS PARTING INSTRUCTIONS
320,MY PURSUITS ARE PEACEFUL AND MY TEMPER I HUMBLY TRUST IS GREATLY GIVEN TO MERCY AND LOVE RETURNED DAVID A LITTLE NETTLE THAT SO DIRECT AN ATTACK ON HIS MANHOOD BUT THERE ARE NONE WHO CAN SAY THAT I HAVE EVER FORGOTTEN MY FAITH IN THE LORD EVEN IN THE GREATEST STREETS
321,IF YOU ARE NOT THEN KNOCKED ON THE HEAD YOUR BEING AN UNPASSER WILL PROTECT YOU AND YOU'LL THEN HAVE A GOOD REASON TO EXPECT TO DIE IN YOUR BED
322,SUCH CHOOSE FOR YOURSELF TO MAKE A RUSH OR TARY HERE
323,BRAVELLY AND GENEROUSLY AS HE BATTLED IN MY BEHALF AND THIS IN MORE WILL I DARE IN HIS SERVICE
324,KEEP SILENT AS LONG AS MAY BE AND IT WOULD BE WISE WHEN YOU DO SPEAK TO BREAK OUT SUDDENLY IN ONE OF YOUR SHOUTINGS WHICH WILL SERVE TO REMIND THE INDIANS THAT YOU ARE NOT ALTOGETHER AS RESPONSIBLE AS MEN SHOULD BE
325,IF HOWEVER THEY TAKE YOUR SKELT AS I TRUST AND BELIEVE THEY WILL NOT DEPEND ON IT UNCUS AND I WILL NOT FORGET THE DEED BUT REVENGE IT HAS BECOME TRUE WARRIORS AND TRUSTY FRIENDS
326,HOLD SAID DAVID PERCEIVING THAT WITH THIS ASSURANCE THEY WERE ABOUT TO LEAVE HIM I AM AN UNWORTHY ENHUMBLE FOLLOWER OF ONE WHO TAUGHT NOT THE DAMNABLE PRINCIPLE OF REVENGE
327,THEN HEAVING A HEAVY SIGH PROBABLY AMONG THE LAST HE EVER DREW IN PINING FOR A CONDITION HE HAD SO LONG ABANDONED HE ADDED IT IS WHAT I WOULD WISH TO PRACTICE MYSELF AS ONE WITHOUT A CROSS OF BLOOD THOUGH IT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO DEAL WITH AN INDIAN AS YOU WOULD WITH A FELLOW CHRISTIAN
328,GOD BLESS YOUR FRIEND I DO BELIEVE YOUR SCENT IS NOT GREATLY WRONG WHEN THE MATTER IS DUELY CONSIDERED AND KEEPING ETERNITY BEFORE THE EYES THOUGH MUCH DEPENDS ON THE NATURAL GIFTS IN THE FORCE OF TEMPTATION
329,THE DELAWARE DOG HE SAID LEANING FORWARD AND PEERING THROUGH THE DIM LIGHT TO CATCH THE EXPRESSION OF THE OTHER'S FEATURES IS AFRAID
330,WHILE THE HEONS HERE IS GROANS
331,AND WHILE HE CAN STARTED ON HIS FEET AND SHOOK HIS SHAGGY COVERING AS THOUGH THE ANIMAL HE COUNTERFEITED WAS ABOUT TO MAKE SOME DESPERATE EFFORT
332,HE HAD NO OCCASION TO DELAY FOR AT THE NEXT INSTANT A BURST OF CRIES FILLED THE OUTER AIR AND RAN ALONG THE WHOLE EXTENT OF THE VILLAGE
333,UNC HAS CAST HIS SKIN AND STEPPED FORTH IN HIS OWN BEAUTIFUL PROPORTIONS
334,I WILL ENDEAVOR IN MY STATEMENT TO AVOID SUCH TERMS AS WOULD SERVE TO LIMIT THE EVENTS TO ANY PARTICULAR PLACE OR GIVE A CLEW AS TO THE PEOPLE CONCERNED
335,I HAD ALWAYS KNOWN HIM TO BE RESTLESS IN HIS MANNER BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION HE WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF UNCONTROLLABLE AGITATION THAT IT WAS CLEAR SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL HAD OCCURRED
336,MY FRIEND'S TEMPER HAD NOT IMPROVED SINCE HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE CONGENIAL SURROUNDINGS OF BAKER STREET
337,WITHOUT HIS SCRAP BOOKS HIS CHEMICALS AND HIS HOMELY ANTAGONIST HE WAS AN UNCOMFORTABLE MAN
338,I HAD TO READ IT OVER CAREFULLY AS THE TEXT MUST BE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT
339,I WAS ABSENT RATHER MORE THAN AN HOUR
340,THE ONLY DUKE OF WHICH EXISTED SO FAR AS I KNEW WAS THAT WHICH BELONGED TO MY SERVANT MINISTER A MAN WHO HAS LOOKED AFTER MY ROOM FOR TEN YEARS AND WHOSE HONESTY IS ABSOLUTELY ABOVE SUSPICION
341,THE MOMENT I LOOKED AT MY TABLE I WAS AWARE THAT SOMEONE HAD RAVAGED AMONG MY PAPERS
342,THE PROOF WAS IN THREE LONG SLIPS I HAD LEFT THEM ALL TOGETHER
343,THE ALTERNATIVE WAS THAT SOMEONE PASSING HAD OBSERVED THE KEY IN THE DOOR HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS OUT AND HAD ENTERED TO LOOK AT THE PAPERS
344,I GAVE HIM A LITTLE BRANDY LEFT HIM COLLAPTED A CHAIR WHILE I MADE A MOST CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE ROOM
345,A BROKEN TIP OF LEAD WAS LYING THERE ALSO
346,NOT ONLY THIS BUT ON THE TABLE I FOUND A SMALL BALL OF BLACK DULL OR CLAY WITH SPECKS OF SOMETHING WHICH LOOKS LIKE SAW US IN IT
347,ABOVE ALL THINGS I DESIRE TO SETTLE THE MATTER QUIETLY AND DISCREETLY
348,TO THE BEST OF MY BELIEF THEY WERE ROLLED UP
349,DID ANY ONE KNOW THAT THESE PROOFS WOULD BE THERE NO ONE SAVE THE PRINTER
350,I WAS IN SUCH A HURRIED TO COME TO YOU YOU LEFT YOUR DOOR OPEN
351,SO IT SEEMS TO ME
352,NOW MISTER SONS AT YOUR'S FOZLE
353,ABOVE WERE THREE STUDENTS ONE ON EACH STORY
354,THEN HE APPROACHED IT AND STANDING ON TIPTOE WITH HIS NECK CRYING HE LOOKED INTO THE ROOM
355,THERE IS NO OPENING EXCEPT THE ONE PAIN SAID ARE LEARNED A GUIDE
356,I'M AFRAID THERE ARE NO SIGNS HERE SAID HE
357,ONE COULD HARDLY HOPE FOR ANY UPON SO DRY A DAY
358,YOU LOVE HIM IN A CHAIR YOU SAY WHICH CHAIR BY THE WINDOW THERE
359,THE MAN ENTERED AND TOOK THE PAPERS SHEET BY SHEET FROM THE CENTRAL TABLE
360,AS A MATTER OF FACT HE COULD NOT SAID SONGS FOR I ENTERED BY THE SIDE DOOR
361,ALONG WOULD TAKE HIM TO DO THAT USING EVERY POSSIBLE CONTRACTION A QUARTER OF AN HOUR NOT LESS
362,THEN HE TOSSED IT DOWN AND SEIZED THE NEXT
363,HE WAS IN THE MIDST OF THAT WHEN YOUR RETURN CAUSED HIM TO MAKE A VERY HURRIED RETREAT VERY HURRIED SINCE HE HAD NOT TIME TO REPLACE THE PAPERS WHICH WOULD TELL YOU THAT HE HAD BEEN THERE
364,MISTER SONG WAS WAS WAS SOMEWHAT OVERWHELMED BY THIS FLOOD OF INFORMATION
365,COMMS HELD OUT A SMALL CHIP WITH THE LETTERS AND IN AND THE SPACE OF CLEAR WOOD AFTER THEM YOU SEE
366,WHAT'S AND I HAVE ALWAYS DONE YOU AN INJUSTICE THERE ARE OTHERS
367,I WAS HOPING THAT IF THE PAPER ON WHICH HE WROTE WAS THIN SOME TRACE OF IT MIGHT COME THROUGH UPON THIS POLISHED SURFACE NO I SEE NOTHING
368,AS HOMES THROUGH THE CURTAIN I WAS AWARE FROM SOME LITTLE RIGIDITY IN AN LARDNESS OF HIS ATTITUDE THAT HE WAS PREPARED FOR AN EMERGENCY
369,HOME TURNED AWAY AND STOOPED SUDDENLY TO THE FLOOR HULLO WHAT IS THIS
370,HOMS HEADED OUT ON HIS OPEN PALM IN THE GLARE OF THE ELECTOR FLIGHT
371,WHAT COULD HE DO HE CAUGHT UP EVERYTHING WHICH WOULD BETRAY HIM AND HE RUSHED INTO YOUR BEDROOM TO CONCEAL HIMSELF
372,I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY THAT THERE ARE THREE STUDENTS TO USE THIS STAIR AND ARE IN THE HABIT OF PASSING YOUR DOOR YES THERE ARE
373,AND THEY ARE ALL IN FOR THE EXAMINATION YES
374,ONE HOTLY LIKES TO THROW SUSPICION WHERE THERE ARE NO PROOFS
375,LET US SEE THIS SUSPICIONS I WILL LOOK AFTER THE PROOFS
376,MY SKULL IT HAS BEEN LEFT A VERY POOR BUT HE IS HARD WORKING AND INDUSTRIOUS HE WILL DO WELL
377,THE TOP FLOOR BELONGS TO MOUTHS DECLARED
378,I DO NOT GO SO FAR AS THAT BUT OF THE THREE HE IS PERHAPS THE LEAST UNLIKELY
379,HE WAS STILL SUFFERING FROM THE SUDDEN DISTURBANCE OF THE QUIET ROUTINE OF HIS LIFE
380,BUT HAVE OCCASIONALLY DONE THE SAME THING AT OTHER TIMES
381,DID YOU LOOK AT THESE PAPERS ON THE TABLE
382,HOW CAME YOU TO LEAVE THE KEY IN THE DOOR
383,ANY ONE THE ROOM COULD GET OUT YES SIR

388,IT WAS THE INDIAN WHOSE DARK SO LOW ADD APPEARED SUDDENLY UPON HIS BLIND
389,HE WAS PACING SWIFTLY UP AND DOWN HIS ROOM
390,THE SET OF ROOMS IS QUITE THE OLDEST IN THE COLLEGE AND IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR VISITORS TO GO OVER THEM
391,NO NAME'S PLEASE SAID HOLMES AS WE KNOCKED AT GUILTY STORE
392,OF COURSE HE DID NOT REALIZE THAT IT WAS I WHO WAS NOTHING BUT NONE THE LESS HIS CONDUCT WAS VERY UNCURTIOUS AND INDEED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES RATHER SUSPICIOUS
393,THOSE VERY IMPORTANT SAID HUMES
394,YOU DON'T SEEM TO REALIZE THE POSITION
395,TO MORROW WAS THE EXAMINATION
396,I CAN'T ALLOW THE EXAMINATION TO BE HELD IF ONE OF THE PAPERS HAS BEEN TAMPERED WITH THE SITUATION MUST BE FACED
397,IT IS POSSIBLE THAT I MAY BE IN A POSITION THEN TO INDICATE SOME COURSE OF ACTION
398,I WILL TAKE THE BLACK CLAY WITH ME ALSO THE PENCIL CUTINGS KUBI
399,WHEN WE WERE OUT IN THE DARKNESS OF THE QUADRANGLE WE AGAIN LOOKED UP AT THE WINDOWS

401,HE IS THE ONE WITH THE WORST RECORD
402,WHY BANISHED HER THE SERVANT WHAT'S HIS GAMEING THE MATTER
403,HE IMPRESSED ME AS BEING A PERFECTLY ON HIS MAN
404,MY FRIEND DID NOT APPEAR TO BE DEPRESSED BY HIS FAILURE BUT SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS IN HALF HUMOROUS RESIGNATION
405,NO GOOD MY DEAR WATCHING
406,I THINK SO YOU HAVE FORMED A CONCLUSION
407,YES MY DEAR WATSON I HAVE SOLVE THE MYSTERY
408,LOOK AT THAT HE HELD OUT HIS HAND
409,ON THE PALM WERE THREE LITTLE PARAMIDS OF BLACK DULLY CLAY
410,AND ONE MORE THIS MORNING
411,IN A FEW HOURS THE EXAMINATION WOULD COMMENCE AND HE WAS STILL IN THE DILEMMA BETWEEN MAKING THE FACTS PUBLIC AND ALLOWING THE CULPER TO COMPUTE FOR THE VALUABLE SCHOLARSHIP
412,HE COULD HARDLY STAND STILL SO GREAT WAS HIS MENTAL AGITATION AND HE RAN TOWARDS HOMES WITH TWO EAGER HANDS OUTSTRETCHED THINK HAVEN'T THAT YOU HAVE COME
413,YOU KNOW HIM I THINK SO
414,IF THIS MATTER IS NOT TO BECOME PUBLIC WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES CERTAIN POWERS AND RESOLVE OURSELVES INTO A SMALL PRIVATE COURT MARSHAL
415,NO SIR CERTAINLY NOT
416,THERE WAS NO MAN SIR
417,HIS TROUBLED BLUE EYES GLANCED AT EACH OF US AND FINALLY RESTED WITH AN EXPRESSION OF BLANK DISMAY UPON BANASTER IN THE FARTHER CORNER

466,THE HONORABLE CHILD SMITH MISS SEYHER'S BROTHER WAS WALKING SWIFTLY UP TOWN FROM MISTER EASILY'S WALL STREET OFFICE AND HIS FACE WAS PALE
467,AT LAST THE COTTON COMBINE WAS TO ALL APPEARANCES AND ASSURED FACT AND HE WAS SLATED FOR THE SUMMIT
468,WHY SHOULD HE NOT BE AS OTHER MEN
469,SHE WAS NOT HERSELF UNNOTABLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN SHE GREATLY ADMIRED INTELLIGENCE OR WHATEVER LOOKED TO HER LIKE INTELLIGENCE AND OTHERS
470,AS SHE AWAITED HER GUESS SHE SURVEYED THE TABLE WITH BOTH SATISFACTION AND AS QUIETED FOR HER SOCIAL FUNCTIONS WERE FEW TO NIGHT THERE WERE SHE CHECKED THEM OFF ON HER FINGERS SIR JAMES CHRISTENED THE RICH ENGLISH MANUFACTURER AND LADY CURTAINED MISTER HARRY IN THE DAY CUSS WELL AND HIS SISTER HARRY
471,MISSUS GRAY HAD MET SOUTHERNERS BEFORE BUT NOT INTIMATELY AND SHE ALWAYS HAD IN MIND VIVIDLY THEIR CRUELTY TO COOL OR NEGROES A SUBJECT SHE MADE A POINT OF INTRODUCING FORTHWITH
472,SHE WAS THEREFORE MOST AGREEABLE SURPRISE TO HEAR MISTER CRUSH WILL EXPRESS HIMSELF SO CORDIALLY AS APPROVING OF NEGRO EDUCATION
473,DO YOU BELIEVE IN SO EDUCATION ASKED MARY TAYLOR
474,I BELIEVE IN THE TRAINING OF PEOPLE TO THEIR HIGHEST CAPACITY THE ENGLISHMAN HERE HEARTILY SECONDED HIM
475,BUT CRUSH WELL ADDED SIGNIFICANTLY THE POSITIVE DEATHLESS ENORMOUS MAY BETWEEN RACES
476,HABANDRAPOOLS WERE SURE THIS AND THE ENGLISHMAN INSTANTING INDIA BECAME QUITE ELOQUENT MISSUS GRAY WAS MYSTIFIED BUT HARDLY DARED ADMITTED THE GENERAL FRIEND OF THE CONVERSATION SEEMED TO BE THAT MOST INDIVIDUAL'S NEEDED TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE SHARPEST SCRUTINY BEFORE BEING ALLOWED MUCH EDIGATION SEEMED TO THEM
477,WHILES OF TOMAHAWIK ADDED TRUSS WELL AVOIDING HIS SISTER'S EYES
478,BUT WE ANOTHER A LIVELY WELCOME
479,MARY TAYLOR HOWEVER RELATED THE TALE OF'S OR TO MISSUS GRAY'S PRIVATE EAR LATER
480,FORTUNATELY SAID MISTER THORPE NOR THE DOZEN SOFTENERS ALL ROBBING AT A BETTER MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING ON MOST OF THESE MATTERS
481,HE KNEW THE SILVER FLEES HE IS ABSOLARS MUST BE RUINED
482,IT WAS THE FIRST GREAT SORROW HIS LIFE IT WAS NOT SO MUCH THE LOSS OF THE COTTON ITSELF BUT THE FANTASY THE HOPES THE DREAMS BUILT ROUND IT
483,I'VE A SWAMP FOR THE COOL SWAMP
484,THE REVELATION OF HIS LOVE LIGHTED AND RIGHT AND SLOWLY TO IT FLAMED LIKE A SUNRISE OVER HIM AND LEFT HIM AND BURNING WONDER
485,HE PANTED TO KNOW IF SHE TOO NUDE OR KNEW AND CARED NOT ALL CARED AND KNEW NOT
486,SHE WAS SO STRANGE IN HUMAN A CREATURE
487,THE WORLD WAS WATER VEILED AND MISTS
488,THEN OF A SUDDEN AT MIDDAY THE SUN SHOT OUT AND STILL NO BREATH OF AIR STIRRED THE SKY WAS LIKE LOOSE STEEL OF THE EARTH STEAM
489,WHERE WAS THE USE OF IMAGINING
490,THE LEGOON HAD BEEN LEVEL WITH THE DIP'S A WEEK AGO AND NOW
491,PERHAPS SHE TOO MIGHT BE THERE WAITING
492,HE STARTED AT THE THOUGHT HE HURRIED FORTH SADLY
493,HE SPLASHED DISTANT THE LONG FARTHER AND FARTHER ONWARD UNTIL HE NEAR THE RAMPARD OF THE CLEARING AND PUT FOOT UPON THE TREE BRIDGE
494,THEN HE LOOKED DOWN THE LEGON WAS DRY
495,HE STOOD A MOMENT BEWILDERED THEN TURNED AND RUSHED UPON THE ISLAND A GREAT SHEET OF DAZZLING SUNLIGHT SWEPT THE PLACE AND BENEATH LAY A MIGHTY MASS OF ALL OF GREEN THICK TALL WET AND WILLILY
496,THE SQUARES OF COTTON SHARP EDGE HEAVY WERE JUST ABOUT TO BURST TO GOALS
497,FOR ONE LONG MOMENT HE PAUSED STUPID A GATE WITH UTTER AMAZEMENT VANLING DIZZILY AGAINST A TREE
498,HE GAZED A BOAT WOULD CLUTCHED ASTONISHED
499,HERE LAY THE READING OF THE RIDDLE WITH INFINITE WORKING PAIN SOME ONE HAD DUG A CAN NOW FROM THE LEGON TO THE CREEK INTO WHICH THE FORMER HAD DRAGGED BY A LONG AND CROOKED WAY THUS ALLOWING INTO EMPTY DIRECTLY
500,HE SAT DOWN WEAK BEWILDERED AND ONE THOUGHT WAS UPPERMOST SOLAR
501,THE YEARS OF THE DAYS OF HER DYING WERE TEN
502,THE HOPE IN DREAM OF HARVEST WAS UPON THE LAND
503,UP IN THE SICK ROOMS OR LAY ON THE LITTLE WIDE BED
504,THE NET AND WEB OF ENDLESS THINGS HAD BEEN CRAWLING AND CREEPING AROUND HER SHE HAD STRUGGLED IN DUMB SPEECHLESS TERROR AGAINST SOME MIGHTY GRASPING THAT STOLE FOR HER LIFE WITH GNAWLED AND CREEPING FINGERS BUT NOW AT LAST WEEKLY SHE OPENED HER EYES IN QUESTION
505,FOR WHILE SHE LAY IN HER CHAIR AND HAPPY DREAMY PLEASURE HAD SOUNDED BIRD AND TREE
506,SHE ROSE WITH A FLEETING GLANCE GATHERED THE SHAWL AROUND HER THEN GLIDING FORWARD WAVERING TREMULOUS SLIPPED ACROSS THE ROAD AND INTO THE SWAMP
507,SHE HAD BEEN BORN WITHIN ITS BORDERS WITHIN AS BORDER SHE HAD LIVED IN GROAN AND WITH IN ITS BORDER SHE HAD MET HER LOVE
508,ON SHE HURRIED UNTIL SWEEPING DOWN TO THE LAGOON AND THE ISLAND LOW THE COTTON LAY BEFORE HER
509,THE CHAIR WAS EMPTY BUT HE KNEW
510,HE DARTED THROUGH THE TREES AND CAUSED A TALL MAN'S STRONGLY BUT SLIMLY MADE
511,IT IS A VERY FINAL PLACE OF RED BRICK SOFTENED BY A PEAL POWDERY LINCOLN WHICH HAS DISPERSED ITSELF WITH HAPPY IRREGULARITY SO AS TO BRING THE RED BRICK INTO TERMS OF FRIENDLY COMPANIONSHIP WITH THE LIMESTONEOUS
512,FOR THE WINDOWS ARE PATCHED WITH WOODEN TAINS AND THE DOOR I THINK IS LIKE THE GATE IT IS NEVER OPENED
513,FOR IT IS A SOLID HEAVY HANDSOME DOOR AND MUST ONCE HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF SHUTTING WITH A SONOROUS BANG BEHIND THE LIVERY BLACKY WHO ADJUST SEEN HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS OFF THE GROUND'S IN A CARRIAGE AND PAIR
514,A LARGE OPEN FIREPLACE WITH RUSTY DOGS IN IT IN A BARE BOARDED FLOOR AT THE FAR END FACES OF WALLS DRAGGED UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR SOME EMPTY CORNBAGS
515,AND WHAT THROUGH THE LEFT HAND WINDOW
516,SEVERAL CLOTHES HORSES A PILLOW IN AN OLD BOX WHITE OPEN AND STUFFED FULL OF COLOURED RAGS
517,AT THE EDGE OF THIS BOX THEIR LIVES A GREAT WOODEN DULL WHICH SO FAR AS MUTILATION IS CONCERNED THERE IS A STRONG RESEMBLANCE TO THE FINEST GREEK SCULPTURE AND ESPECIALLY IN THE TOTAL LOSS OF ITS NOSE
518,THERE IS THREE OF THE HOUSE IS PLAIN NOW
519,BUT THERE IS ALWAYS AS STRONGER SENSE OF LIFE WHEN THE SUN IS BRILLIANT AFTER RAIN AND NOW HE IS POURING DOWN HIS BEAMS AND MAKING THE SPARKLES AMONG THE WET STRAW AND LIGHTING UP EVERY PATCH OF VIVID GREEN MOSS AND THE RED TILES OF THE RED TIE AND THE RED TILES OF THE RED TILES AND THE RED TILES OF THE RED TILES HEAD AND THE RED TILED SHED AND THE RED TILES OF THE RED TILES OF THE RED TILES SHED AND THE RED TILE SHED AND THE RED TILES AND THE RED TILES OF THE RED TILESHED AND THE RED
520,WHERE THE GREAT BARN DOORS ARE THROWN WHITE OPEN AND MEN ARE BUSY THERE MENDING THE HARNESS UNDER THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF MISTER GOBBY THE WIDOW AEA WHO ENTERTAINS THEM WITH A LATEST TROUBLES AND GOSSIP
521,HEED SORROW OFTEN TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN HER AUNT'S BACK WAS TURNED OF LOOKING AT THE PLEASING REFLECTION OF HERSELF IN THOSE COLLEGE SERVICES FOR THE OAK TABLE WAS USUALLY TURNED UP LIKE A SCREEN AND WAS MORE FOR ORNAMENT THAN FOR USE AND SHE COULD SEE HERSELF SOMETIMES AND SHE COULD SEE HERSELF SOMETIMES AND SHE COULD SEE YOURSELF SOMETIMES THAN FOR USE AND SHE COULD SEEUSE AND SHE COULD SEEUSE AND SHE COULD SEE YOURSELF SOMETIMES
522,DO NOT SUPPOSE HOWEVER BUT MISSUS POYSER WAS ELDERLY OR TRUE WHICH IN HER APPEARANCE SHE WAS A GOOD LOOKING WOMAN NOT MORE THAN EIGHT IN THIRTY OF FAIR COMPLEXION AND SANDY HERE WELL SHAKEN LIGHT FOOTED
523,THE FAMILY LIKE THIS BETWEEN HER AND HER NIECE DAINAMORAS WITH A CONTRAST BETWEEN HER KEENNESS AND DINESS SIRRAPIC GENTLENESS OF EXPRESSION MIGHT HAVE SERVED A PAINTER AS AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION FOR A MARTHA AND MERRY
524,HER TONGUE WAS NOT LESS KEEN THAN HER EYE AND WHENEVER A DAMSEL CAME WITH A AIR SHOT SEEMED TO TAKE UP AN UNFINISHED LECTURE AS A BARREL ORGAN TAKES UP A TUNE PRECISELY AT THE POINT WHERE IT HAD LEFT OFF
525,THE FACT THAT IT WAS TURNING DAY WAS ANOTHER REASON WHY IT WAS INCONVENIENT TO HAVE THE WIDTHOUSE AND WHY CONSEQUENTLY MISSUS POYSER SHOULD SCOLD MOLLY THE HOUSE MADE WITH UNUSUAL SEVERITY
526,TO ALL APPEARANCE MOLLY HAD GOT THROUGH HER AFTER DINNER WORK IN AN EXEMPTORY MANNER HAD GLEANED HERSELF WITH GREAT TO MATCH AND NOW CAME TO ASK SUBMISSIVELY IF SHE SHOULD SIT DOWN TO HER SPINNING TO MILKING KIND
527,SPITTING INDEED
528,I NEVER KNEW YOUR EQUALS FOR GALLOWSNESS
529,YOU TAUGHT YOU TO SCRAP UP FOR I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW
530,COME THE WALL FOR THE WIDTHOUSE INDEED
531,THAT'S WHICH HE'D LIKE TO BE DOING IS IT
532,THAT'S THE WAY WITH YOU THAT'S THE ROAD YOU'D ALL LIKE TO GO HAD LONGS TO RUIN
533,MISTER AT BLAZE
534,YOU ARE A RAREIN PROCEEDING DOWN TO YOUR WORK A LITTLE WHILE AFTER ITS TIME TO PUT BY
535,MONIE RHEARS BRIGHT TOLD THESE PUT IT DOWN TO WARM
536, COLD IS IT MY DARLING BLESS YOUR SWEET FACE
537,SHE'S GOING TO PUT THE IRONY THINGS AWAY
538,MONIE ARE I DID LIE TO DO INTO THE BARN TO TELL ME TO SEE THE WENT ON
539,NO NO HONEY'D GET HER FEET WELL SAID MISSUS POYSER CARRYING AWAY HER IRON
540,DID EVER ANYBODY SEE THE LIKE SCREAMED TO MISSUS POYSER RUNNING TOWARDS THE TABLE WHEN HER EYE HAD FALLEN ON THE BLUE STREAM
541,TOTTY HOWEVER HAD DESCENDED FROM HER CHAIR WITH GREAT SWIFTNESS AND WAS ALREADY IN RETREAT PORDS THE DAIRY WITH A SORT OF WADDLING RUN AND AN AMOUNT OF FAT ON THE NEIGHBOUR NECK WHICH MADE HER LOOK LIKE THE METAMORPHOSIS OF A WHITE SUCKLING PIG
542,AND SHE WAS VERY FOND OF YOU TOO IN RACHEL
543,I OFTEN HEARD HER TALK OF YOU IN THE SAME SORT OF WAY
544,WHICH HE HAD BAD MAN ILLNESS AND I WAS ONLY ELEVEN YEARS OLD SHE USED TO SAY YOU'LL HAVE A FRIEND ON HER IN YOUR AUNT RACHEL IF I AM TAKEN FROM YOU FOR SHE HAS A KIND HEART AND I'M SURE I'M SURE I'VE FOUND IT SO
545,AND THERE'S LYNDON IN THE HOUSE AS I COULD WELL SPARE YOU FOR I GOT LOTS OF SHOOTING AND TABLE CLOTHING AND TOWING THAT ISN'T MADE UP
546,BUT NOT MORE THAN ONCE IN THE BIBLE AND SAID DINON
547,NAY GERAND YOU NEVER HEARD ME SAY THAT ALL PEOPLE ARE CALLED TO FORSAKE THEIR WORK IN THEIR FAMILIES
548,WE CAN ALL BE SERVANTS OF GOD WHEREVER OUR LOT IS CAST BUT HE GIVES US DIFFERENT SORTS OF WORK ACCORDING AS HE FITS US FORWARD AND TELLS US TO IT
549,I CAN NO MORE HELP SPENDING MY LIFE AND TRYING TO DO WHAT I CAN FOR THE SOULS OF OTHERS THEN YOU COULD HELP RUNNING IF YOU'RE HEARD LITTLE TODY CRYING AT THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE THE VOICE WOULD GO TO YOUR HEART YOU WOULD THINK THE DEAR CHILD WAS IN TROUBLE OR IN DANGER
550,I HAVE STRONG A SHIRTS THAT NO EVIL WILL HAPPEN TO YOU AND MY UNCLE IN THE CHILDREN FOR ANYTHING I HAVE DONE
551,I DIDN'T PREACH WITHOUT DIRECTION
552,DIRECTION
553,I HAD A COMMON PATIENCE WITH YOU
554,BUT HIS TIME THE TWO GENTLEMEN HAD REACHED THE PALINGS AND HAD GOT DOWN FROM THEIR HORSES HE WAS PLAYING THEY MEANT TO COME IN
555,SAID MISTER IRWINE WITH HIS STATELY CORDIALITY
556,OH SIR DON'T MENTION IT SAID MISSUS POYSER
557,I DO HIDING YOUR KITCHEN
558,POYSER IS THAT AT HOW MISS HE
559,SAID CAPTAIN DATYTHORN SITTING HIMSELF WHERE HE COULD SEE ALONG THE SHORT PASSAGE TO THE OPEN DAIRY DOOR
560,NO SIR HE ISN'T HE'S GONE TO RACETER DOES HE MISTER WEST THE FACTOR ABOUT THE WALL
561,BETH'S FATHER AND BARN SIR IF HE'D BE OF ANY USE
562,NO THING YOU I'LL JUST LOOK AT THE WOLVES AND LEAVE A MESSAGE YOU ABOUT THEM WITH YOUR SHEPHERD
563,I MUST COME ANOTHER DAY AND SEE YOUR HUSBAND I WANT TO HAVE A CONSEIL TASTE WITH HIM ABOUT HORSES
564,FOR IF IS ANYWHERE IN THE FARM WE CAN SEND FOR HIM IN A MINUTE
565,OH SIR SAID MISSUS POYSER RATHER ALARMED YOU WOULDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL
566,BUT YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT THAT I DO SIR
567,I THINK I SHOULD BE DOING YOU A SERVICE TO TURN YOU OUT OF SUCH A PLACE
568,I KNOW FARM IS IN BETTER ORDER THAN ANY OTHER WITHIN TEN MILES OF US AND AS FOR THE KITCHEN HE ADDED SMILING I DON'T BELIEVE THERE IS ONE IN THE KINGDOM TO BE IT
569,BY THE BYE I NEVER SEE YOUR DAIRY I MUST SEE YOUR DARING MISSUS POYSER
570,THIS MISSUS POYSER SAID BLUSHING AND BELIEVING THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN HER MILK PANDS AND WOULD ADJUST HIS OPINION OF HER TO THE APPEARANCE OF HER DAIRY
571,OH I HAVE NO DOUBT IT'S AN CAPITAL ORDER
572,THE PERIL SPAND LIKE THAT OF THE CRYSTAL PALACE WAS A TEMPORARY EXHIBIT
573,THE LONDON BLACK WAS LOST TEMPORARY BUT NOT PERMANENT SUPPLYING BEFORE IT WAS TORN OUT NO FEWER THEN THREE THOUSAND LAMPS AND HOTELS CHURCHES STORES AND DWELLINGS AND THE VICINITY OF HOLBORN VIDA
574,THERE MESSIERS JOHNSON AND HAMPER PUT INTO PRACTICE MANY OF THE IDEAS NOW STANDERED IN THE ART AND SECURED MUCH USEFUL DATA FOR THE WORK IN NEW YORK OF WHICH THE STORY HAS JUST BEEN TOLD
575,THE DATA ELECTRIC MACHINE THOUGH SMALL WAS ROBUST FOR UNDER ALL THE VARYING STREETS OF WATER POWER AND THE VICISSITUDES OF THE PLAT TO WHICH IT BELONGED IT CONTINUED IN ACTIVE YEARS UNTIL EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE SEVENTEEN YEARS
576,OWING TO HIS INSISTENCE ON LOW PRESSURE DIRECT CURRENT FOR USE IN DENSELY POPULATED DISTRICTS AS THE ONLY SAFE AND TRULY UNIVERSAL PROFITABLE WAY OF DELIVERING ELECTRICAL ENERGY TO THE CONSUMERS MEDICINE HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY SPOKEN OF AS AN OPPONENT OF AS AN OPPONENT
577,WHY IF WE A PRACTASTATION AT THE FALLS IT IS A GREAT ECONOMY TO GET IT UP TO THE CITY
578,THERE SEEMS NO GOOD REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT IT WILL CHANGE
579,BROUGHT US THE PRAIRIES AND FREE AND THOUGHT AS THE WINDS THAT SWEPT THEM HE IS IDIOS AND CHRONICLY OPPOSED TO LOOSE AND WASTEFUL METHODS TO PLANS OF EMPIRE THAT NEGLECT THE POOR THE DAY
580,EVERYTHING HE HAS DONE HAS BEEN AIM THAT THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY THE CONTRACTION OF SPACE THE INTENSOCATION OF CULTURE
581,FOR SOME YEARS IT WAS NOT FOUND FEASIBLE TO OPERATE MOTIVES ON ALTERNATING CURRENTS AND THAT REASON WAS OFTEN URGED AGAINST IT SERIOUSLY
582,IT COULD NOT BE USED FOR ELECTRIC BLAZING OR DEPOSITION NOR COULD A CHARGE TO REACH BATTERIES ALL OF WHICH ARE EASILY WITHIN THE ABILITY OF THE DIRECT
583,BUT WHEN IT CAME TO BE A QUESTION OF LIGHTING A SCATTERED SUBURB A GROUP OF DWELLINGS ON THE OUTSKIRTS A REMOTE COUNTRY RESIDENCE OR A FAR MOUSE THE ALTERNATING CURRENT IN ALL ELEMENTS SAVE ITS DANGER WAS AND IS IDEAL
584,EDISON WAS IN TOLERANT OF SHAM AND SOUGHTY AND NOTHING WOULD SATISFY HIM THAT COULD NOT STAND CROSS EXAMINATION BY MIGHT RESULT TESTS TUBE AND GALDENANEMETER
585,UNLESS HE COULD SECURE AN ENGINE OF SMOOTAR RUNNING AND MORE EXACTLY GOVERNMENT REGULATED THAN THOSE AVAILABLE FOR HIS DIABAL AND LAUGHED EDDISON REALIZED THAT HE WOULD FIND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE A STUDY LIGHT
586,MISTER ADDISON WAS A LEADER FAR AHEAD OF THE TIME
587,HE OBTAINED THE DESIRED SPEED AND LOADED WITH A FRICTION BREAK ALSO REGULATOR OF SPEED WHAT WAITED FORT INDICATOR TO VERIFY IT
588,THEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO KNOWN WAY TO LIBERATE AN ENGINE FOR CONTINUOUS RUNNING AND MISTER EDITION INFORMED ME THAT AS A MARINE ENGINES STARTED BEFORE THE SHIP LEFT THE YORK AND CONTINUED RUNNING UNTIL IT REACHED ITS HOME PORT SO AN ENGINE FOR HIS PURPOSE IS MUST PRODUCE LIGHT AT ALL TIMES
589,EDISON HAD INSTALLED HIS HISTORIC FIRST GREAT CENTRAL STATION SYSTEM IN NEW YORK ON THE MULTABLE ARC SYSTEM COVERED BY HIS FEEDER AND MAIN INVENTION WHICH RESULTED IN A NOTABLE SAVING IN THE COST OF CONDUCTORS AS AGAINST THE STRAIGHT TWO WIRE SYSTEM THROUGH OUT OF THE TREE KIND
590,HE SOON FORCE SAW THAT STILL GREATER ECONOMY WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS NOT ALONE FOR THE LARGER TERRITORY OPENING BUT FOR THE COMPACT DISTRICT OF LARGE CITIES
591,THE STRONG POSITION HELD BY THE ADISAN SYSTEM UNDER THIS STRENUOUS COMPETITION THAT WAS ALREADY SPRINGING UP WAS ENORMOUSLY IMPROVED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF THE THREE WIRE SYSTEM AND IT GAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPETUS TO INCANDESCENT LIGHTING
592,IT WAS SPECIALLY SUITED FOR A TRIAL PLAT ALSO IN THE EARLY DAYS WHEN A YELLED OF SIX OR EIGHT LAMPS TO THE HORSE POWER WAS CONSIDERED FOR CONGRATULATION
593,THE STREET CONDUCTORS WERE OF THE OVERHEAD FULL LINE INSTRUCTION EDWARD INSTALLED BY THE INSTRUCTION COMPANY THAT HAD BEEN ORGANIZED BY ADISON TO BUILD AN EQUIP CENTRAL STATIONS
594,MEANWHILE HE HAD CALLED UPON ME TO MAKE A REPORT OF THE THREE WIRE SYSTEM KNOWN IN ENGLAND AS THE HOPKINSON BOTH DOCTOR JOHN HOPKINS IN AND MISTER EDITION BEING INDEPENDENT INVENTORS AT PRACTICALLY THE SAME TIME
595,I THINK HE WAS PERHAPS MORE APPRECIATIVE THAT I WAS OF THE DISCIPLINE OF THE EDISON CONSTRUCTION TO PARDON AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US TO WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING OF THE FOURTH BEFORE WE STARTED UP
596,BUT THE PLANT RAN AND IT WAS THE FIRST THREE WIRE STATION IN THIS COUNTRY
597,THEY WERE LATER USED AS RESERVED MACHINES ON FINELY WITH THE ENGINE RETIRED FROM SERVICE AS PART OF THE COLLECTION OF ETASUNIA BUT THEY REMAINED IN PRACTICALLY AS GOOD CONDITION AS ONE INSTALLED IN EIGHTEEN A LIVERY
598,THE ARCH LAMP AND STOLE OUTSIDE A CUSTOMERS PROMISES OR IN A CIRCUIT FOR PUBLIC STREET LIGHTING BURNED SO MANY HOURS NIGHTLY SO MANY NIGHTS IN THE MONTH AND WAS PAID FOR AT THAT RATE SUBJECT TO DEBATE FOR HOURS WHEN THE LAMP MIGHT BE OUT THE LATCH OF IT
599,EDISON HELD THAT THE ELECTRICITY SOLD MUST BE MEASURED JUST LIKE GAS OR WATER ANY PROCEEDED TO DEVELOP A METER
600,THERE WAS INFINITE SKEPTUSES AND AROUND HIM ON THE SUBJECT AND WHILE OTHER INVENTORS WERE ALSO GIVING THE SUBJECT THEREFORE THE PUBLIC TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT ANYTHING SO UTTERLY INTANGIBLE AS ELECTRICITY THAT COULD NOT BE SEEN OR WEIGHT AND ONLY GAVE SECONDARY EVIDENCE OF ITSELF THAT COULD NOT BE SEEN OR WEIGHTED AND ONLY GAVE OR WEIGHED AND ONLY GAVE OR WEIGHED AND ONLY GAVE OR WEIGHT AND ONLY GAVE OR WAITED USE
601,AND THE ADITION ELECTRICAL METER IS NO LONGER USED DESPITE ITS EXCELLENT QUALITIES
602,THE PRINCIPAL EMPLOYED IN THE ATMOSPHERE IS THAT WHICH EXEMPTIFIES THE POWER OF ELECTRICITY TO DEEP IMPOSE A CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE
603,ASSOSIUSATED WITH THE SIMPLE FORM OF APPARATUS WERE VARIOUS INGENIOUS DETAILS AND REFINMENTS TO SECURE REGULARITY OF OPERATION FREEDOM FROM INACURACY AND IMMUNITY FROM SUCH TEMPORARY AS WOULD PERMITFTIVE CURRENT OR DAMAGE
604,THIS STANDARD AT US IN METER PRACTICE WAS TO REMOVE THE CELLS ONCE AMONGST TO THE METER ROOM OF THE CENTRAL STATION COMPANY FOR EXAMINATION ANOTHER SAT BEING SUBSTITUTED
605,IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT MISTER D W J G JENKS READ AN INTERESTING PAPER BEFORE THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE TWO DOUBLEATRICAL ENGINEERS ON THE SIX YEARS OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE HAD UP TO THAT TIME WITH THE METER THEN MORE GENERALLY IN USE THAN ANY OTHER
606,THE OTHERS HAVING BEEN AN OPERATION TO SHORT A TIME TO SHOW DEFINITE RESULTS ALTHOUGH THEY ALSO WENT QUICKLY TO A DIFFERENT AND BASIS
607,IN THIS CONNECTION IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED THAT THE ASSOCIATION OF EDITION ILLUMINATING COMPANIES IN THE SAME YEAR ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS UNANIMOUSLY TO THE EFFECT THAT THE EDISON METER WAS AFTER AND THAT ITS USE WAS NOT EXPENSIVE FOR STATIONS ABOVE ONE THOUSAND LIGHTS AND THAT THE BEST FINANCIAL RESULTS WERE STATIONS ABOVE ONE THOUSAND LIGHTS AND LIGHTS AND LIGHTS AND THAT THE BESTATIONS ABOVE ONE THOUSAND LIGHTS AND THAT THE BESTATIONS ABOVE ONE THOUSAND LIGHTS AND THAT THE BEST UNIQUEIONS ABOVE ONE THOUSAND LIGHTS AND THAT THE BESTATIONS ABOVE ONE THOUSAND LIGHTS AND THAT THE BEST HONORS WAS NOT EXPENSIVE
608,THE LEADER CONTINUED IN GENERAL SERVICE DURING EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE AND PROBABLY UP TO THE CLOSE OF THE CENTURY
609,HE WAITED AND HIGHWAY THE METER PLATES AND PURSUED EVERY LINE OF INVESTIGATION IMAGINABLE BUT ALL IN VAIN
610,HE FELL HE WAS UP AGAINST IT AND THAT PERHAPS ANOTHER KIND OF A JOB WOULD SUIT HIM BETTER
611,THE PROBLEM WAS SOUGHT
612,WE WERE MORE INTERESTED IN THE TECHNICAL CONDITION OF THE STATION THAT IN THE COMMERCIAL PART
613,WE HAD METERS IN WHICH THEY WERE TWO BOTTLES OF LIQUID
614,HERE SHE WOULD STAY COMFORTED AND SOOTHED AMONG THE LOVELY PLANS AND RICHARD'S OBJECTS REJOICING THE HEART OF OLD TURNER THE GARDEN WHO SENT POLLY SPURSED RAPTUROUS ENTRANCE HAD TAKEN HER INTO HIS GOOD GRACES FOR ALL TIME
615,EVERY CHANCE SHE COULD STEAL AFTER BREAKFAST HOURS WERE OVER AND AFTER THE CLAMOROUS DEMANDS OF THE BOYS UPON HER TIME WERE FULLY SATISFIED WAS SEIZED TO FLY ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND TO THE FLOWERS
616,THEN DEAR SAID MISSUS WITH ME YOU MUST BE KINDED TO HER THAN EVER THINK WHAT IT WOULD BE FOR ONE OF YOU TO BE AWAY FROM HOME EVEN AMONG FRIENDS
617, SOMEHOW OF ALL THE DAYS WHEN THE HOME FEELING WAS THE STRONGEST THIS DAY IT SEEMED AS IF SHE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER
618,IF SHE COULD ONLY SEE FROGSY FOR JUST ONE MOMENT
619,OH SHE'S ALWAYS AT THE PIANO SAID MAN SHE MUST BE THERE NOW SOMEWHERE AND THEN SOMEBODY LAUGHED
620,AT THIS THE BUNDLE OPEN SUDDENLY AND OUT POPPED PHRONSIE
621,BUT POLLY COULDN'T SPEAK AND IF JASPER HADN'T CAUGHT HER JUST IN TIME SHE WOULD HAVE TUMBLED OVER BACKWARD FROM THE STOOL PHRONSIE AND ALL
622,ASKED PHRONSIE WITH HER LITTLE FACE CLOSED TO CALL THESE OWN
623,NOW YOU'LL STAY CRIED MAN SAY POLLY WON'T YOU
624,OH YOU ARE THE DEAREST AND BEST MISTER KING I EVER SAW BUT HOW DID YOU MAKE MAMMY THAT HER COME
625,IS ANY SPLENDID CRIED JASPER AND INTENSE PRIDE SWELLING UP FATHER AND KNEW HOW TO DO IT
626,THERE HE SAID SOOTHINGLY PATTING HER BROWN PL AS HE HAD
627,I KNOW GASPED POLLY CONTROLLING HER SOBS I WON'T ONLY I CAN THINK YOU
628,ASKED PHRONSIE AN INTENSE INTEREST SLIPPING DOWN OUT OF POLLY'S ARMS AND CROWDING UP CLOSE TO JASPER SIDE
629,YES ALL ALONE BY HIMSELF A SORT OF JASPER BEAMATELY AND THINKING CURIOUSLY TO THE OTHERS TO STOP THEIR LAUGHING HE DID NOW TRULY PHRONSIE
630,AH NO CHAPTER I MUST GO BY MY VERY OWN SELF
631,THERE CHAP YOU'VE GOT IT LAUGHED PURSY WHILE THE OTHER'S SCREAMED AT THE SIDE OF JASPER'S SPACE
632,DON'T MIND IT POLLY WHISPERED JASPER WASN'T HER FAULT
633,DEAR ME AJACULATED THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND THE UTMOST AMAZEMENT AND SUCH A TIME AS I'D HAD TO GET HER HERE TOO
634,HOW DID HER MOTHER EVER LET HER GO
635,SHE ASKED IMPULSIVELY I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU COULD PERSUADE HER FATHER
636,I DIDN'T HAVE ANY FEARS IF I WORKED IT LIGHTLY SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN COMPLACENTLY
637,HE CRIED AND HIGH DUNGEON JUST AS IF HE OWNED THE HOLE OF THE PEPPARDS AND COULD DISPOSE AT THEM ALL AND SUIT HIS FANCY
638,AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS SO DELIGHTED WITH HIS SUCCESS THAT HE HAD TO BURST OUT INTO A SERIES OF SHORT HAPPY BITS OF LAUGHTER THAT OCCUPIED QUITE A SPACE OF TIME
639,AT LAST HE CAME OUT OF THEM AND WHITE HIS FACE VIGOROUSLY
640,IT IS SIXTEEN YEARS SINCE JOHN BURNS AND DIED
641,HIS WIFE NOW EYES BESIDE HIM AND THE WHITE SHAVE THAT MARKS THEIR GRAVES GLEAMS ACROSS THE LEAP FIELDS
642,FROM THE NORWEET AND GRAVE YARD ONE LOOKS OUT OVER A VAST CHECKERBOARD MARKED OFF IN SQUARES OF WHEAT AND CORN LIGHT AND DARK DARK AND LIGHT
643,FROM THE GRAVEYARD GATE ONE CAN COUNT A DOZEN GAILY PAINTED FARM HOUSES THE GILDED AT WEATHER VEINS ON THE BIG RED BARNS WEAK AT EACH OTHER ACROSS THE GREEN AND BROWN AND YELLOW FIELDS
644,THE AIR AND THE EARTH ARE CURIOUSLY MADE IT AND INTERMINGLED AS IF THE ONE WERE THE BREATH OF THE OTHER
645,HE WAS A SPLENDID FIGURE OF A BOY TALL AND STRAIGHT AS A YOUNG PINE TREE WITH A HANDSOME HEAD AND STORMY GRAY EYE STEEPLY SET UNDER A SERIOUS BROW
646,THAT'S NOT MUCH OF A JOB FOR AN ATHLETE HERE I'VE BEEN TO TOWN ON BACK
647,NOT EXAGGER THAT YOU SLEEP LATE
648,SHE GATHERED UP HER REIGNS
649,PLEASE WAIT FOR ME MERRY AE AE OFE
650,I NEVER SEE LOSE SIGHED OVER HERE
651,HOW PROUD YOU'VE GOT SINCE YOU CAME HOME I WISH I HAD AN AVONLEA TO MAUME MY ORCHARD
652,I GET WET TO MY KNEES WHEN I GO DOWN TO PICK CHERRIES
653,INDEED HE HAD LOOKED AWAY WITH THE PURPOSE OF NOT SEEING IT
654,THEY THINK YOUR PROUD BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN AWAY TO SCHOOL OR SOMETHING
655,THERE WAS SOMETHING INDIVIDUAL ABOUT THE GREAT FARM A MOST UNUSUAL CHIMNESS AND CARE FOR DETAIL
656,ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ROAD FOR A MILE BEFORE YOU REACHED THE FOOT OF THE HILL STOOD TALL O SAGE ARE AND HEDGES THEY'RE GLOSSY GREEN MOCKING OFF THE YELLOW FIELDS
657,ANY ONE THERE ABOUT WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THE RICHEST FARMS ON THE DIVIDE AND THAT THE FARMER WAS A WOMAN ALEXANDERBURSON
658,THERE IS EVEN A WHITE ROW OF BEEHIVES IN THE ORCHARD UNDER THE WALLET TREES
659,FRANK RED ENGLISH SLOWLY AND THE MORE HE READ ABOUT THIS DIVORCE CASE THE ANGRY YEAR HE GREW
660,MARRY SIGHED
661,A BRISK WIND HAD COME UP AND WAS DRIVING PUFFY WHITE CLOUDS ACROSS THE SKY
662,THE ORCHARD WAS SPARKLING AND RIPPLING IN THE SUN
663,THAT INVITATION DECIDED HER
664,OH BUT I'M GLAD TO GET THIS PLACE MODE
665,JUST NOW THE WILD ROSES THEY ARE ONLY SO SPICY AFTER A RAIN
666,WE NEVER HAD SO MANY UP THEM IN HERE BEFORE
667,I SUPPOSE IT'S THE WHITE SEASON WILL YOU HAVE TO CUT THEM TO
668,I SUPPOSE THAT'S THE WENT SEASON TOO THEN
669,IT'S EXCITING TO SEE EVERYTHING GROWING SO FAST AND DID IT THE GRASS COAT
670,ARTIUS BRASHED LOOK AT THE SPIDER WHIPS ALL OVER THE GRASS
671,IN A FEW MOMENTS HE HEARD THE CHERRY STOPPING SMARTLY INTO THE PALE AND HE BEGAN TO SWING HIS SIGH WITH THAT LONG EVEN SPOKE THAT YOU AMERICAN BOYS EVER BURN
672,MARRY PICKED CHERRIES AND SANG SOFTLY TO HERSELF STRIPPING ONE GLITTERING BRANCH AFTER ANOTHER SHIVERING WHEN SHE THOUGHT A SHOWER OF RAINDROPS ON HER NECK AND HAIR
673,AND AMIABLE MODE HIS WAY SLOWLY DOWN TOWARD THE CHERRY TREES
674,THAT SUMMER THE REINS HAD BEEN SO MANY AN OPPORTUNITY THAT IT WAS ALMOST MORE THAN SHEPHERD AND HIS MAN COULD DO TO KEEP UP WITH THE CORN THE ORCHARD WAS A NEGLECTED WILDERNESS
675,I DON'T KNOW ALL WITH THEM BUT I KNOW BENNANTS ARE
676,IF I FEEL THAT WAY I FEEL THAT WAY
677,HE REACHED UP AMONG THE BRANCHES AND BEGAN TO PICK THE SWEET INSIPID FRUIT LONG I'VE RECOVERED BERRIES TIPPED WITH MATE PINK LIKE WHITE COREL THAT FALL TO THE GROUND UNHEEDEDED ALL SUMMER THROUGH
678,HE DROPPED A HANDFUL INTO HER UP
679,YES DON'T YOU
680,OH ADDERS ALL MUCH ONLY YOU SEEMS KIND OF STAY AT AND SCHOOLTY TREE
681,WHEN SHE USED TO TELL ME ABOUT HIM I ALWAYS WONDERED WHETHER SHE WAS AND A LITTLE IN LOVE WITH HIM
682,IT WOULD SERVE YOU ALL RIGHT IF SHE WALKED OFF WITH QUARREL
683,I LIKED TO TALK THE CAR ON ABOUT NEW YORK AND WHAT A FELLOW CAN DO THERE
684,I'LL HAIL
685,TREATLY YOU ARE NOT THINKING OF GOING OFF THERE
686,MY'S FACE FELL UNDER HIS BROODING GAZE
687,I'M SURE I'M SURE I'M SURE I'M SURE SHE MURMURED
688,I DON'T MUCH STAND AROUND OF THE GONE
689,I WANT TO BE DOING SOMETHING ON MY OWN ACCOUNT
690,SOMETIMES I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING AT ALL AND SOMETIMES I WANT TO PULL THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE DIVIDE TOGETHER HE THREW OUT HIS ARM AND BROUGHT IT BACK WITH A JERK SO LIKE A TABLECLOTH
691,I GET TIRED OF SEEING MAN AND HORSES GOING UP AND DOWN UP AND DOWN UP AND DOWN
692,I WISH YOU WANT SO RESTLESS AND DIDN'T GET SO WORKED UP OVER THINGS SHE SAID SADLY
693,THANK YOU HE RETURNED SHORTLY
694,AND WHO NEVER USED TO BE CROSS TO ME
695,I CAN'T PLAY WITH YOU LIKE A LITTLE BOY ANY MORE HE SAID SLOWLY THAT'S WHAT YOU MISS MERRY

698,THAT WON'T LAST IT WILL GO AWAY AND BEING WILL BE JUST AS THEY USE TOO
699,I PRAY FOR YOU BUT THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS IF YOU PRAYED YOURSELF
700,I CAN'T PRAY TO HAVE THE THINGS I WANT HE SAID SLOWLY AND I WON'T PRAY NOT TO HAVE THEM NOT IF I'M DAMNED FOR IT
701,THAN ALL OUR PUT TIMES BAR OVER
702,SATERNITY AUGUST FIFTEENTH THE SEA AND BROKEN ALL ROUND NO LAND IN SIGHT
703,THE HORIZON SEEMS EXTREMELY DISTANT
704,ALL MY DANGER AND SUFFERINGS WERE NEEDED TO STRIKE A SPARK OF HUMAN FEELING OUT OF HIM BUT NOW THAT I AM WELL IS NATURE HAS RESUMED IT AWAY
705,YOU SEE ANXIOUS MY UNCLE I SAID SEEING HIM CONTINUALLY WITH HIS GLASS TO HIS EYE ANXIOUS
706,ONE MIGHT BE WOULD LESS REASON THAN NOW
707,I AM NOT COMPLAINING AT THE GREATEST SLOW BUT THAT THE SEAT IS SO WIDE
708,WE ARE USING TIME AND THE FACT IS I HAVE NOT COME ALL THIS WAY TO TAKE A LITTLE SAIL UPON A POND ON A RAFT
709,HE CALLED THE SEA UPON AND I LONG VOYAGE TAKING A LITTLE SAIL
710,THEREFORE DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT VIEWS AND PROSPECTS
711,I TAKE THIS IS MY ANSWER AND I LEAVE THE PROFESSOR TO BITE HIS LIPS WITH IMPATIENCE
712,SUNDAY AUGUST SIXTEENTH
713,NOTHING KNEW WHETHER UNCHANGED THE WIND FRUCTIONS
714,BUT THERE SEEMED NO REASON OF FEAR
715,THE SHADOW OF THE RAFT WAS CLEARLY OUTLINED UPON THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES
716,TRULY THE SEA IS OF INFINITE WEB
717,AND MUST BE AS WIDE AS THE MEDITERRANEAN OR THEY ATLANTIC AND WHY NOT
718,THESE THOUGHTS AGITATED ME ALL DAY AND MY IMAGINATION SCARCELY CALM DOWN AFTER SEVERAL HOUR SLEEP
719,I SHUDDER AS I RECALLED THESE MONSTERS TO MY REMEMBRANCE
720,I SAW AT THE HAMPERED ME SOON THE SKELETON OF ONE OF THESE CREATURES THIRTY FEET IN LENGTH
721,I SUPPOSE PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK WAS OF MY OPINION TOO AND EVEN SHARED MY FEARS FOR AFTER HAVING EXAMINED THE PIT HIS EYES TRAVERSED THE OCEAN FROM SIDE ASIDE
722,TEXT EIGHT AUGUST EIGHTEENTH
723,DEARING HIS WATCH I SLEPT
724,TWO HOURS AFTERWARDS A TERRIBLE SHOCK AWOKE ME
725,THE RAFT WAS HEAVED UP ON A WATERY MOUNTAIN AND PITCHED DOWN AGAIN AT A DISTANCE OF TWENTY FATHOMS
726,THERE'S A WHILE A WELL CRIED THE PROFESSOR
727,FIGHT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION NOW THE RECTELS ROSE THEY WHEELED AROUND OUR LITTLE RAFT WITH A RAPIDITY GREATER THAN THAT OF EXPRESSED TRADE
728,TWO MONSTER'S ONLY RECRUATING ALL THIS COMMOTION AND BEFORE MY EYES ARE CHEAP RENT HOUSE OF THE PRIMITIVE WORLD
729,I CAN DISTINGUISH THE EYE OF IT THE ASSURES GLOWING LIKE A RED HOT COLL AND AS LARGE AS A MAN'S HEAD
730,ITS JAW IS ENORMOUS AND ACCORDING THE NATURALIST IT IS ARMED WITH NO LESS THAN HARM HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO TEETH
731,THOSE HUGE CREATURES ATTACKED EACH OTHER WITH A GREATEST AND AMASSITY
732,SUDDENLY THE ACIANTS AND THE PLUSHY OF SOURCE DISAPPEAR BELOW LEAVING A WHIRLPOLE EDDY IN THE WATER
733,AS FOR THE IF THE ASSURES HAS HE RETURNED WHO SUBMERING CABIN
734,THE JOINS BECOME LOST IN THE DISTANCE
735,THE WEATHER IF WE MAY USE THE TERM WILL CHANGE BEFORE LONG
736,THE ATMOSPHERE IS CHARRED WITH VAPOURS PROVIDED WITH THE ELECTRICITY GENERATED BY THE EVAPORATION OF SAILING WATERS
737,THE ELECTRIC LIGHT CAN SCARCELY PENETRATE TO THE DANCE CURTAIN WHICH IS DROPPED OVER THE THEATRE ON WHICH THE BATTLE OF THE ELEMENTS IS ABOUT TO BE WAGED
738,THE AIR IS HEAVY THE SEA IS CALM
739,FROM TIME A FLEECEY TOUGHED MIST WE YET SOME GLEAMING LIGHT LEFT UPON IT DROPPED DOWN UPON THE DENSE FLOOR OF GRAY AND LOSES ITSELF IN THE OPAQUE AN IMPENETRABLE MASS
740,THE ATMOSPHERE AS EVIDENTLY CHARGED AND SIR CHARGED WITH ELECTRICITY
741,THE WIND NEVER LULLS BUT TO ACQUIRE INCREASED STRENGTH THE VAST BANK OF HEAVY CLOUDS AS A HUGE RESIVOR A FEARFUL WINDY GUSTS AND RUSHING STORMS
742,THERE'S A HEAVY STORM COMING ON I CRIED POINTING TOWARDS THE HORIZON
743,THOSE CLOUDS SEEM AS IF THEY WERE GOING TO CRUSH THE SEA
744,ON THE MAST ALREADY I SEE THE LIGHT PLAY OF ALLOWMENT SAINT ANDREW'S FIRE THE OUTSTRUITS SAIL KUTCHES NOT A BREATH OF WIND AND HANGS LIKE A SHEET OF A LAD
745,BUT IF WE HAVE NOW CEASED TO ADVANCE WHY DO WE YET LEAVE THAT SO LOOSE WHICH AT THE FIRST SHOCK OF A TEMPEST MAY CAPSIZE US IN A MOMENT
746,THAT WILL BE THE SERVICE NO NO NEVER
747,THE PILED UP VAPOURS CONTENSED IN THE WATER AND THE AIR PUT IN A VIOLENT ACTION TO SUPPLY THE BACK AND LEFT BY THE CONDENSATION OF THE MIST RISES ITSELF INTO A WHIRLWIND
748,HOME STAIRS NOT
749,FROM THE UNDER SURFACE OF THE CLOUDS THEY ARE CONTINUAL ADMISSION OF LURED LIGHT ELECTRIC MATTER IS IN CONTINUAL EVOLUTION FROM THEIR COMPONENT MONARCHS THE GASHES ELEMENTS OF THE AIR NEED TO BE SLAKED WITH MORESTER FOR INNUMERABLE COLUMNS OF WATER RUSHED UPWORDS INTO THE AIR AND FALL BACK AGAIN AND WHITE FOE
750,I REFER TO THE PHENOMENA IT IN A CASE THE FIGURE IS OBLITERATED
751,IS THE ATMOSPHERE CONDITION HAVING ONCE REACHED A INTENSITY TO BECOME FINAL
752,THE RAPPED BEARS ARE STILL TO THE SOUTH EAST
753,AT NEW IN THE VIOLENCE OF THE STORM REDOUBLES
754,EACH OF US IS LASHED TO SOME PART OF THE RAFT
755,THE WAVES RISE ABOVE OUR HEADS
756,THEY SEEMED TO BE WE ARE LOST BUT I AM NOT SURE
757,HE KNOWLEDGE HIS CONSENT
758,THE FARBALL HALF OF IT WHITE HALF AZURE BLUE AND THE SIZE AND A TEN INCH SHELL MOVED SOLLY ABOUT THE RAFT BUT REVOLVING ON ITS OWN AXIS WITH ASTONISHING VELOCITY AS IF WIDTH ROUND BY THE FORCE OF THE WHIRLWIND
759,HERE COMES THERE AT GUIDES NOW IT IS UP THE RAGGED STUMP OF THE MAST THEN'S IT LIGHTLY LEAPS ON THE PROVISION BAG DESCANS WITH A LIGHT BOUND AND JUST SKINS THE PATTERN MAGAZINE HORRIBLE
760,WE SHALL BE BLOWN UP BUT NO THE DAZZLING DISK OF MYSTERIOUS LIGHT NIBBLING LEAPS ASIDE IT APPROACHED HIS ARMS WHO FIXES HIS BLUE EYE UPON ITS SUDDENLY IT THREATS THE HEAD OF MY UNCLE WHO FALLS UPON HIS KNEES WITH HIS HEAD DOWN TO AVOID IT
761,A SUFFOCATING SMELL OF LIGHTED FILLS THE AIR IT ENTERS THE THROAT IT FILLS THE LUNGS
762,WE SUFFER STIFLING PANES
763,AND HOW ODD THE DIRECTIONS A LOOK
764,POOR ALICE
765,IT WAS THE WHITE RABBIT RETURNING SPLENDIDLY DRESSED WITH A PAIR WHITE KID GLOVES IN ONE HAND AND A LARGE MAN IN THE OTHER HE CAME TROTTING ALONG AND A GREAT HURRY MUTTERING TO HIMSELF AS HE CAME OH THE DUCHESS THE DUCHESS
766,OH WON'T SHE BE SAVAGE IF I'VE KEPT HER WAITING
767,I WAS TOOK UP THE FAT AND GLOVES AND AS THE HALL WAS VERY HOT SHE KEPT FANNING HERSELF ALL THE TIME SHE WENT ON TALKING DEAR DEAR DEAR HOW QUEER EVERYTHING IS TO DAY
768,AND YESTERDAY THINKS WENT UNJUST AS USUAL
769,I WONDER IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED IN THE NIGHT
770,I ALMOST STATE I CAN NEVER FEEL IN A LITTLE DIFFERENT
771,I'LL TRY IF I KNOW ALL THE THINGS I USED TO KNOW
772,I SHALL NEVER GET TO TWENTY AT THAT RIGHT
773,OUT CHEERFULLY HE SEEMS TO GRIN HOW NEATLY SPREAD HIS CLAWS AND WELCOME LITTLE FISHES IN WOULD GENTLY SMILING JAWS
774,NO I'D MADE IT MY MIND ABOUT IT IF I'M ABLE I'LL STAY DOWN HERE
775,IT WILL BE NO USE THEY'RE PUTTING THEIR HEADS DOWN AND SAYING COME UP A GET IN DINNER
776,I AM SO VERY TIRED BEING ALL ALONE HERE
777,AND I DECLARE IT'S TOO BAD THAT IT IS
778,I WISH I HADN'T CRIED SO MUCH SAID ALICE AS SHE SWUNG ABOUT TRYING TO FIND HER WAY OUT
779,I SHALL BE PUNISHED FOR IT NOW I SUPPOSE BY BEING DROWNED IN MY OWN TEARS
780,THAT WILL BE A QUEER THING TO BE SURE
781,I AM VERY TIRED OF SWIMMING ABOUT HERE OH MOUSE
782,CRIED ALICE AGAIN FOR THIS TIME THE HOUSE WAS BRISTLING ALL OVER AND SHE FELT CERTAIN IT MUST BE REALLY OFFENDED
783,WE WON'T TALK ABOUT HER ANY MORE IF YOU'D RATHER NOT WE INDEED
784,WE WANT YOU TO HELP US PUBLIC SOME LEADING WORK OF THE LIZZERS FOR THE GENERAL AMERICAN MARKET WILL YOU DO IT
785,BUT CONDITION IS THAT I WILL BE PERMITTED TO MAKE LUTHER TALK AMERICAN STREAM LION SAID TO SPEAK BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER GET PEOPLE WHETHER IN OR OUTSIDE THE LUTHER IN CHURCH ACTUALLY TO READ LUTHER UNLESS WE MAKE HIM TALK AS HE WOULD TALK TO DAY TO AMERICANS
786,LET US BEGIN WITH THAT HIS COMMENTARY REGALATIONS
787,THE UNDERTAKING WHICH SEEMED SO ATTRACTIVE WHEN VIEWED AS A LITERARY TASK PROVED THE MOST DIFFICULT ONE AND AT TIMES BECAME OPPRESSIVE
788,IT WAS WRITTEN AND LATIN
789,THE WORK HAD TO BE CONVINCED
790,A WORD SHOULD NOW BE SAID ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF LIUTHER'S COMMENTARY AND RELATIONS
791,MUCH LATER WHEN A FRIEND OF HIS WAS PREPARING AN EDITION OF ALL HIS LATIN WORKS HE REMARKED TO HIS HOME CIRCLE IF I HAD MY WAY ABOUT IT THEY WOULD REPUBLIC ONLY THOSE OF MY BOOKS WHICH HAVE DOCTRINE MY RELATIONS FOR INSTANCE AND
792,IN OTHER WORDS THESE THREE MEN TOOK DOWN THE LECTURES WHICH LUTHER ADDRESSED MISCHIEVOUS AND THE COURSE OF RELATIONS AND ROAR PREPARED THE MANUSCRIPT FOR THE FRNDER
793,IT PRESENTS LIKE NO OTHER OF LIUTHER'S WRITINGS THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF CHRISTIANITY THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE SOONER FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST MERITS ALONE
794,BUT THE ESSENCE OF LUDHER'S LETTERS IS THERE
795,THE LORD WAS GIVEN US POWER TO TEACH AND TO HEAR LET HIM ALSO GIVE US THE POWER TO SERVE AND TO DO LOOK TOO
796,THE WORD OF OUR GOD SHALL STAND FOR EVER
797,IN EVERY WAY THEY SOUGHT TO UNDER MINE THE AUTHORITY OF SAINT PAUL
798,THEY SAID TO THE RELATIONS YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO THINK HIGHLY OF PAUL
799,HE WAS THE LAST TO TURN ACROSS
800,POCK HIM LATER IN HIS BENEATH US
801,INDEED HE PERSECUTED THE CHURCH OF PRICE FOR A LONG TIME
802,DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT GOD FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW LUTER IN HEREITICS WOULD DISEN ON HIS ENTIRE CHURCH
803,AGAINST THESE BOASTING FALSE OF PUZZLES PAUL BOLDLY DEFENCE HIS EPOCHALLIC AUTHORITY IN MINISTRY
804,AS THE AMBASSADOR OF A GOVERNMENT IS HONOURED FOR HIS OFFICE AND NOT FOR HIS PRIVATE PERSON SO THE MINISTER OF CHRIST SHOULD RESOLVE HIS OFFICE IN ORDER TO GAIN AUTHORITY AMONG MEN
805,POLE TAKES PRIDE IN HIS MINISTRY NOT TO HIS OWN PHRASE BUT TO THE PRAISE OF GOD
806,PAW AND A POSSIBLE NOT OF MEN ET CETERA
807,EVEN HE CALLS MINISTERS TO THE AGENCY OF MAN OR HE CALLS THEM DIRECTLY AS HE CALLED THE PROPHETS AND PROPOSALS
808,PAW THE CLARES THAT THE FALSE APOSTLES WERE CALLED OR SENT NEITHER BY MEN NOR BY MAN
809,THE MOST THEY COULD CLIMB IS THAT THEY WERE SENT BY OTHERS
810,HE MENTIONED THEY ALSO'S FIRST BECAUSE THEY WERE APPOINTED DIRECTLY BY GOD
811,BECAUSE WAS NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY
812,FOR A PERSON TO POSSESS KNOWLEDGE IS NOT ENOUGH
813,IF SPOIL'S ONE'S BEST WORK
814,WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT PAUL WAS MAKING TOO MUCH OF HIS CALL
815,I DID NOT THEN REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MINISTRY
816,I KNOW NOTHING OF THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH BECAUSE WE WERE TAUGHT SOPHEST DREAMS SAID A CERTAINTY AND NOBODY UNDERSTOOD SPIRITUALTING
817,THIS IS NO CENTRAL PRIDE IT IS WHOLLY PRIDE
818,AND GOD THE FATHER WHO RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD
819,BECAUSE SEEMED SUPERVULOUS AND FIRST SIGHT
820,THESE PERVERS OF THE RIGHTNESS OF CHRIST RESIST THE FATHER AND THE SUN AND THE WORKS OF THEM BOTH
821,IN THIS WHOLE PISTOL CALLED TREATS OF THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST
822,BY HIS RESURRECTION CHRIST ONE THE VICTORY OVER LAW SIN FLESH WORLD DEVIL DEATH HOW IN EVERY EVIL
823,FIRST TWO
824,AND ALL THE BREADTH ROOM WHICH ARE WITH ME
825,THIS SHOULD GO FAR AND SHUTTING THE MOUSE OF THE FALSE APARTMENTS
826,ALTHOUGH THE BROTHER AND WITH ME ARE NOT A PUZZLES LIKE MYSELF YET THEY ARE ALL OF ONE MIND WITH ME THANK RIGHT AND TEACHERS I DO
827,THEY DO NOT GO WITH THE ENEMIES OF THE GOSPEL PREDOMINING THEY GO WERE THE CUSHIONS ARE
828,WHY THEY NOT INVADE THE CATHOLIC PROVINCES AND PREACHED THEIR DOCTRINE TO GOBLESS PRINCES BISHOPS AND DOCTORS AS WE HAVE THEM BY THE HELP OF GOD
829,WE LOOKED FOR THAT REWARD WHICH I HAVE NOT SEEN NOR I HEARD NEITHER HAVE ENTERED INTO THE HEART OF MAN
830,NOT ALL THE GOATIONS HAD BECOME DIVERT IT
831,THESE MEANS CANNOT BE CONTINUING
832,THEY WERE MADE DIVINE REGARDLESS OF MEN'S OPINION
833,WHEREOVER THE MEANS OF GRACE ARE FOUND THERE IS THE HOLY CHURCH EVEN NO ANTIGRACED MEANS THERE
834,SO MUCH FOR THE TITLE OF THE EPISTLE NOR FOLLOWS THE GREETING OF THE IMPOSSIBLE FIRST THREE
835,GRACE BE TO YOU IN PEACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
836,THE TERMS OF GRACE AND PEACE ARE COMMON TERMS WITH POLE AND ARE NOW PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD
837,THE GREETING OF THE APOSTLES WERE FRESH AND
838,GRACE AND FALLS THE COMMISSION OF SINS PEACE AND A HAPPY CONSCIENCE
839,THE WORLD RAN'S THIS A PERNICIOUS DOCTRINE
840,EXPERIENCE PROCESS
841,HOWEVER THE GRACE AND PEACE OF GOD WILL
842,MANY SHOULD NOT SPECULATELY ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
843,WAS IT NOT ENOUGH TO SAY FROM GOD THE FATHER
844,TO DO SO AS TO LOSE GOD ALTOGETHER BECAUSE GOD BECOMES INTOLERABLE WHEN WE SEEK HIM MEASURE INTO COMPREHEND HIS INFINITE MAJESTY
845,HE CAME DOWN TO EARTH LIVED AMONG MEN SUFFERED WAS CRUCIFIED AND THEN HE DIED STANDING CLEARLY BEFORE US SO THAT OUR HEARTS AND EYES MAY FASTENED UPON HIM
846, EMBRACED HIM AND FORGET ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
847,DID NOT CHRIST HIMSELF SAY I AM THE WAY IN THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE NO MAN COMEETH UNTO THE FATHER BUT BY ME
848,WHEN YOU ARE YOU ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD APART FROM THE QUESTION OF JUSTIFICATION YOU MAY BE AS PROFOUND AS YOU LIKE
849,WE ARE TO HEAR CHRIST WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE FATHER AS OUR DIVINE TEACHER
850,AT THE SAME TIME WALKING FERNS OUR CREED THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD
851,THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD IS APPARENT AND THAT POLESCRIBES TO HIM DIVINE POWERS EQUALLY WITH THE FATHER AS FOR INSTANCE THE POWER TO THE SPIN'S GRACE AND CASE
852,JUST STILL PEACE AND RACE LIES IN THE PROVINCE OF GOD WHO ALONE CONCURATE THESE BLESSINGS THE ANGELS CANNOT
853,OTHERWISE PAW SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN GRACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND PEACE FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
854,THE ARIANS TOOK CHRIST FOR A NOBLE IN PERFECT CREATURES SUPERIOR EVEN TO THE ANGELS BECAUSE BY HIM GOD CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH
855,MEALAM IT ALSO SPEECH HIGHLY OF CHRIST
856,POST MIXTURE IS SEEN
857,HE NEVER LOSE HIS SIDE OF THE PURPOSE OF HIS OFFICIAL
858,NOT GOLD THEIR SILVER OR PASSIONS OR AN ANGEL BUT HIMSELF WHAT FOR
859,NOT FOR A CROWN WHERE A KINGDOM OR A GOODNESS BEFORE SINS
860,UNDER SCORE THESE WORDS FOR THEY ARE FULL OF COMFORT FOR SORE CONSCIENCE
861,HOW MAY WE HAVE TO AN COMMISSION OF OUR SINCE
862,PALIENCES THE MAN WHO IS NAMED JESUS CHRIST AND THE SON OF GOD GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SENSE
863,SINCE CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS IF STANDS TO REASON THAT THEY CANNOT BE PUT AWAY BY OUR OWN EFFORTS
864,THIS SENTENCE ALSO TO FINDS OUR SINS AS GREAT SO GREAT IN FACT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD COULD NOT MAKE AMENDS FOR A SINGLE SIN
865,THE GREATNESS OF THE RANSOM CHRIST SON OF GOD INDIGATES THIS
866,THE VICIOUS CHARACTER OF SIN IS BROUGHT OUT BY THE WORDS WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS
867,BUT WE ARE CARELESS WE MAKE LIGHT OF SIN
868,WE THINK THAT BY SOME LITTLE WORK WERE MERIT WE CAN DISMISS IN
869,THIS PASSAGE THEN BEARS OUT THE FACT THAT ALL MAN ARE SOLD INTO SIN
870,THIS ATTITUDE STRINGS FROM A FALSE CONCEPTION OF SIN THE CONCEPTION AS SAND AS A SMILE MATTER EASILY TAKEN CARE OF BY GOOD WORKS THAT WE MUST PRESENT OURSELVES AND TO GO WITH THE GOOD CONSCIENCE THAT WE MUST THE OLD NO SIN BEFORE MAY FEEL THAT CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS
871,THIS ATTITUDE IS UNIVERSALLY DEVELOPED IN THOSE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES BETTER THAN OTHERS
872,BUT THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE IN COMFORT OF THE WORDS FOR OUR SINS IS LOST UPON THEM
873,ON THE OTHER HAND WE ARE NOT TO REGARD THEM IS SO TERRIBLE THAT WE MUST DESPAIR
874,HE PASSES ABRUPTLY FROM PURSES TO IDEAS AND NUMBERS AND FROM IDEAS AND NUMBERS TO PERSONS FROM THE HEAVENS AND MEN FROM ASTERNITY TO PHYSIOLOGY HE CONFUSES A RATHER DOES NOT THE STEAMER DOES NOT THE ENGLISH SUBJECT AN OBJECT AND OBJECT IN OBJECT THE ENGLISH SUBJECT AND OBJECT AND OBJECT IN OBJECT
875,THE INFLUENCE WHICH STOOD TENIA'S HAS EXERCISED UPON DEXTERITY IS DUE PARTLY TO A MISUNDERSTANDING
876,IN THIS SUPPOSED DEPTHS OF THIS DIAEL THE NEW PLANISTS FOUND HIDDEN MEANS AND CONNEXIONS WITH THE JEWISH AND CHRISTIAN SCRIPTURES AND OUT OF THEM THEY ELICITED DOCTRINES QUIET AT VARIANCE WITH THIS THIRD OF PLATO
877,THEY WERE ABSORBED IN HIS THEOLOGY AND WERE OTHER THE MENION OF HIS NAME WHILE THAT WHICH WAS TRULY GREAT AND TRULY CHARACTERISTIC IN HIM HIS EFFORT TO REALIZE AND CONNECT INSTRUCTIONS WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD BY THEM AT ALL
878,THERE IS NO DANGER OF THE MODERN COMMENTATORS UNDER TEN YEARS FALLING INTO THE ABSURDITIES OF A NEIAL PLATINISTS
879,IN THE PRESENT DAY WE ARE WELL AWARE THAT AN ANCIENT PHILOSOPHER IS TO BE INTERPRETED FROM HIMSELF AND BY THE CONTEMPORARY HIS CHIEF THOUGHT
880,THE FANCY OF THE NEW PLANISTS ARE ONLY INTERESTING TO US BECAUSE THEY EXHIBIT OF THIEVES OF THE HUMAN MIND WHICH PREVAILED WILDLY IN THE FIRST CENTURIES OF THE CHRISTIAN EUROPE AND IS NOT WHOLLY EXTINCT IN OUR OWN DAY
881,BUT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF PLATER AND IN SPIRIT THEY ARE OPPOSED TO HUNT
882,WE DO NOT KNOW HOW PLAETA WOULD HAVE ARRANGED HIS OWN EYELIDS OR WHETHER THE THOUGHT OF ARRANGING ANY OF HIM BESIDES TO EXTREMITIES WHICH HE HAS EXPRESSLY CONNECTED WAS EVER PRESENT TO HIS MIND
883,THE DIAL IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH ANIMAL CREATION INCLUDING UNDER THIS TERM THE HEAVILY BODIES AND WITH MEN ONLY AS ONE AMONG THE ANIMALS
884,BUT HE HAS NOT AS YET THE FIND THIS INTERMEDIATEARY WHICH LIFE SOME WAY BETWEEN MEDICINE IN MATHEMATICS AND HE WOULD HAVE FELT THAT THERE WAS AS GREAT AN IMPIETY THEORIES OF PHYSICS FIRST IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AS IN PLACING THE BODY BEFORE THE SOUL
885,WITH HERACITUS HE ACKNOWLEDGED THE PERPETUAL FLUX LIKE AN EXTENESS HE ASSERTED THE PREDOMINANCE OF MINE ALTHOUGH EMITTING AN ELEMENT OF NECESSITY WHICH REASON IS INCAPABLE OF SUBDUED IN NUMBER
886,MAY IF NOT ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE PRETO CREDIT VELOCITY ARE INCLUDED IN DATIMIOUS
887,IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE RELATION OF THE IDEAS TO GOD OR OF GOD TO THE WORLD WAS DIFFERENTLY CONCEIVED BY HIM AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF HIS LIFE
888,THE IDEAS ALSO REMAIN BUT THEY HAVE BECOME TYPES IN NATURE FORMS OF MEN ANIMALS BIRDS FISHES
889,THE STYLE AND PLAN OF THE TEN YEARS DIFFERENT GREATLY FROM THAT OF ANY OTHER OF DEPLOTANIC DIALOOKS
890,BUT PLO HAS NOT THE SAME MYSTERY OVER HIS INSTRUMENT WHICH THE EXHIBITS SEAT OF FEATURES OR SUPPOSING
891,NOTHING AND EXCEED THE BEAUTY WERE ART OF INTRODUCTION IN WHICH HIS USING WORDS AFTER HIS BECAUSE AND MANNER
892,BUT IN THE REST OF THE WORK THE POWER OF LANGUAGE SEEMS TO FAIL HIM AND THE DRAMATIC FORM IS WHOLLY GIVEN UP
893,HE COULD WRITE IN ONE STYLE BUT NOT IN ANOTHER AND THE GREEK LANGUAGE HAD NOT AS YET BEEN FASHIONED BY ANY POET OR PHILOSOPHIC TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL PHENOMENA
894,AND HENCE WE FIND THE SAME SORT OF CLUMSINESS IN THE TEN YEARS OF PLAITO WHICH CHARACTERISES TO FILL US OFFACALPONE OF LUCRETIOUS
895,THERE IS A WANT OF FLOW AND OFTEN A DEFECT OF RHYTHM THE MEANING IS SOMETIMES AND PURE AND THERE IS A GREATER USE OF OPPOSITION AND MORE OF REPETITION THAN OCCURS AND PLATOES EARLIER RIDGES
896,PLATELE HAD NOT THE COMMAND OF HIS MATERIALS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENABLED HIM TO PRODUCE THE PERFECT WORK OF OUR
897,SALREADY BEGINS THE TAMIA'S WITH A CELARY OF THE REPUBLIC
898,AND NOW HE DESIRES TO SEE THE IDEAL STATE SET IN MOTION IT WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW SHE BELIEVED IN SOME GREAT STRUGGLE
899,AND THEREFORE TO YOU I TURN TO ME AS IT IS AN OF WONDROUS WHO ARE AT ONCE A PHILOSOPHER IN A STATESMAN AND TO YOU QUIDIOUS WHOM ALL OPINIONS KNOW TO BE SIMILARLY ACCOMPLISHED INTO HER LIBERTIES WAS ALSO FITTED BY NATURE AND EDUCATION TO SHARE IN OUR DISPERSE
900,I WILL YOU TO ME AS A PROOFS I APPROVED
901,LISTEN BARON'S TO A TALE OF SILENCE WHO BEING THE FRIEND OF JOUBINESS MY GREAT GRANDFATHER TOLD IT TO MY GRANDFATHER QUIDIOUS AND HE TOLD ME
902,SOME POEMS OF SOLEMN WERE RECITED BY THE VOICE
903,AND WHAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE POET SAID THE PERSON WILL BE TO REMARK
904,THE SUBJECT WAS A VERY NOBLE ONE IT DESCRIBED THE MOST FAMOUS ACTION IN WHICH THE ATHENIAN PEOPLE WERE EVER ENGAGED
905,BUT THE MEMORY OF THEIR EXPLOITS HAD PASSED AWAY OWING TO THE LAPSE OF TIME AND THE EXTINCTION OF THE ACTORS
906,TELL US SAID THE OTHER THE WHOLE STORY AND WEAR SOLEMN HER THIS STORY
907,BUT IN EACH IT THE CONDITIONS OF OUR OWN AND OTHER LANDS ARE BY OATHS REGISTERED FOR EVER IN OUR TEMPLES
908,THE GENIALITIES WHICH HAVE RECITED TO US OUT OF YOUR OWN AND O'CLOCK ARE A MERE CHILDREN'S STORY
909,FOR IN THE TIMES BEFORE A GREAT FLOOD HAPPENS WAS THE GREATEST AND BEST OF CITIES AND DEAD THE NOBLEST DEEDS AND HAD THE BEST CONSTITUTION OF ANY UNDER DE FACE OF HEAVEN
910,SALAND MARVELLED AND DESIRED TO BE FORMED OF THE PARTICULARS
911,NIGHT THOUSAND YEARS HEAVY LAST SINCE SHE FOUND AT YOURS AND EIGHT THOUSAND SINCE YOU FOUND AT OURS AS OUR ANIMALS RECORD
912,MANY LAWS EXISTING MARVELS WHICH ARE THE COUNTER PART OF YOURS AS THEY WERE IN THE OLD AND TIME
913,I WILL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THEM TO YOU AND I SHALL READ THE ACCOUNT OF THEM I TO SEIZE YOU IN THE SACRED MAGISTRURES
914,OBSERVED AGAIN WHAT PIERRE ELASTIC IN THE PURSUIT OF WISDOM SEARCHING OUT THE DEEP THINGS OF THE WORLD AND APPLYING THEM TO THESE OF MEN
915,THE MOST FAMOUS OF THEM ALL WAS THE OVERTHROW OF THE ISLAND OF A TWENTY
916,FOR AT THE PERIL OF HER OWN EXISTENCE AND WHEN THE UTTER HOWLINGS HAD DESERTED HER SHE REPELLED IN VIGOR AND OF HER OWN ACCORD GAVE LIBERTY TO ALL THE NATIONS WITHIN DE PILLARS
917,THIS IS THE EXPLANATION OF THE SHADOWS WHICH ARE FOUND IN THAT HEART OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN
918,BUT I WOULD NOT SPEAK AT A TIME BECAUSE I WANTED TO REFRESH MY MEMORY
919,THEN NOW LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU THE ORDER OF OUR ENTERTAINMENT FIRST TO MEUS WAS A NATURAL PHILOSOPHY OF THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD GOING DOWN TO THE CREATION OF MEN AND THEN I SHALL RECEIVE THE MEN WHOM HE HAS CREATED AND SOME OF WHOM HE HAS CREATED AND SOME OF WHOM HE HAS CREATED AND SOME OF WHOM HE HAS CREATED
920,BUT ALREADY AT A POINT IN ECONOMIC EVOLUTION FAR AND STATING THE IMAGINES OF THE LADY SPECIALIZED CONSUMPTION OF GOODS AS AN EVIDENCE OF PECUNIARY STRENGTH HAD BEGUN TO WORK OUT IN A MORE OR LESS LEOPARD'S SYSTEM
921,THE UTILITY OF CONSUMPTION AS AN EVIDENCE OF WEALTH IS TO BE CLASS AS A DURATION OF GROWTH
922,SUCH CONSUMPTION AS FALSE WHO THE WOMEN IS MERELY INSIDENTAL TO THEIR WORK IT IS AMUSED TO THEIR CONTINUED LABOUR AND NOT A CONCEPTION DIRECTED TO THEIR OWN COMFORT AND FULLNESS OF LIFE
923,WITH A FIRID FORMS AND CULTURE THIS TABULA CHANGE IN SIMPLE CUSTOM OF A MORAL LESS RIGOROUS CHARACTER BUT WOULD EVER BE THE THEATRICAL BASES OF THE DISTINCTION WHICH IS MAINTAINED WHETHER IT BE IT A BLUE OR AN ARCH TO CONVENTIONALITY THE FEATURES OF THE CONVENTIONAL SCHEME OF CONSUMPTION
924,IN THE NATURE OF THINGS COUNTRIES AND THE COMFORTS OF LIFE BELONGED TO THE MEASURE CLASS
925,UNDER THE TABOO SUDDENICIALS AND MOPED ELY CERTAIN BEVERAGES I STRICTLY RESERVED FOR THE USE OF THE APPEARED HOUSE
926,BRISKINESS AND THE OTHER PATHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE FREE USE OF STEEMONENTS THEY HAVE ATTEND IN THEIR TURN TO BECOME UNDERFIC AS BEING A MARK AT THE SECOND REMOVE OF THE SUPERIOR STATE IS OF THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO FORT THE INDULGENCE
927,IT HAS EVEN HAPPENED THAT THE NAME FOR CERTAIN DISEASED CONDITIONS OF THE BODY ARISING FROM SUCH AN ORIGIN HAS PASSED INTO EVERY DAY SPEECH AS A CINNORMAL OR GENTLE
928,THE CONCEPTION OF LUXURIES IN THE TRUISANCE IS A CONCEPTION DIRECTED TO THE COMFORT OF THE CONCEALER HIMSELF AND IS THEREFORE A MARK OF THE MASTER
929,WITH MANY QUALIFICATIONS WITH MORE QUALIFICATIONS US THE PATRIARCHAL TRADITION HAS GRADUALLY WEAKENED THE GENERAL ROOF IS FELL TO BE RIGHT AND BINDING THAT WOMEN SHOULD CONSUME ONLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR MASTERS
930,THE OBJECTION OF COURSE PRESENT ITSELF THAT EXPENDITURE ON WOMEN'S DRESS AND HOUSEHOLD PERSONALITY IS AN OBVIOUS EXCEPTION TO THIS ROOM BUT IT WILL APPEARING THE SEQUEL THAT THIS EXCEPTION IS MUCH MORE OBVIOUS AND SUBSTANTIAL
931,THE CUSTOM OF FESTIVE GATHERING'S PROBABLY ORIGINATED IN MOTIVES OF COMMUNITY AND RELIGION THESE MOTIVES ARE ALSO PRESENT IN THE LIGHTED DEVELOPMENT THAT THEY DO NOT CONTINUE TO BE THE SOLE MOTIVES
932,THERE IS A MORE OR LESS ELABORATE SYSTEM OF RANKING GROUPS
933,THIS DIFFERENTATIONS FELL THAT BY THE INHERITANCE OF WEALTH AND THE CONSTANT INHERITANCE OF TINTILLITY
934,MANY OF THESE AFFULATED GENTLEMEN OF MEASURE ARE THE SAME TIME SPECIMEN OF SUBSTANCE IN THEIR OWN RIGHT SO AT SOME OF THEM ESCAPE AT ALL OTHERS ONLY POSTLY TO BE WAITED AS BY CURIOUS CONSUMUS
935,SO MANY OF THEM HOWEVER AS MAKE UP THE RETAINER AND HUNDREDS ON OF THE PATRON MAY BE CAUSED AS THY CURIOUS CONSUMA WITHOUT QUALIFICATION
936,MANY OF THESE AGAIN AND ALSO MANY OF THE OTHER RESTOR CHRISTIANITY HAVING TURN ATTACHED TO THE PERSONS AMOR LESS COMPREHENSIVE GROUP OF THY CARRIAGE CONSUMEA IN THE PERSONS OF THEIR WIFE'S AND CHILDREN THEIR SERVANTS RETAINERS ET CETERA
937,THE WHARING OF UNIFORMS OR LIVERIES IMPIES A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF DEPENDENCE AND MAY EVEN BE SAID TO BE A MARK OF SOLITUDE WERE YOU ARE A SENSIBLE
938,THE WHAREERS OF UNIFORMS AND LIVERYS MAY BE RESCUED INTO TWO CLASSES THE FREE AND THE SEVEN OR THE NOBLE AND THE IGNOBLE
939,BUT THE GENERAL DISTINCTION IS NOT A NET ACCOUNT TO BE OVERLOOKED
940,SA THOSE OFFICES WHICH ARE BY RIGHT THE PROPER EMPLOYMENT OF THE LEISURE CROSS A NOBLE SUCH AS GOVERNMENT FIGHTING HUNTING THE CARE OF ARMS AND ACCOUTRMENTS AND THE LIGHT IN SHORT THOSE WHICH MAY BE CLASS THIS OSTENSIVELY PEDITORY IMPORTANCE
941,ANOTHER AS IN THESE CASES THE MEANINGAL OFS IN QUESTION HAS TO UDIRECTLY WITH A PRIMARY MEASURE IMPLEMENTS OF FIGHTING IN HUNTING IT EASILY ACQUIES ARE REFLECTED ON OR REFIC CHARACTER
942,THE LIVERY BECOMES OBNOXIOUS TO ME THE OLD WHO ARE REQUIRED TO WEAR IT
943,AND A GENERAL WAY THOUGH NOT WHOLLY NO CONSISTENCY THESE TWO GROUPS COINCIDE
944,THE DEPENDENT WHO WAS FIRST ELIGATED FOR THESE DUTIES WAS THE WIFE OR THE CHIEF WIFE AND AS WOULD BE EXPECTED IN THE LATE TO DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSETUTION WHEN THE NUMBER OF PERSONS BY HIM THESE DOUCHES ARE CASIMATELY PERFORMED RACHEL AND ARROWS THE WIFE REMAINS FOR HOSTILE
945,BUT AS WE DESCEND THE SOCIAL SCALE THE POINT IS PRESENTLY REACHED WHERE THE DUTIES OF THY CURIOUS LEISURE AND CONSUMPTION DEVOLED UPON THE WIFE ALONE
946,IN THE COMMUNITIES OF THE WESTERN CULTURE THIS POINT IS AT PRESENT FOUND AMONG THE LOAMID OF CLOTHS
947,IF BEAUTY TO COMFORT IS ACHIEVED AND IT IS A MORE OR LESS FOR TRUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES ETHERE THEY MUST BE ACHIEVED BY MEANS AND METHODS THAT COMMAND THEMSELVES THROUGH THE GREAT ECONOMICAL OF WASTED EFFORT
948,THE MAN OF THE HOUSEHOLD ALSO CAN DO SOMETHING IN THIS DIRECTION AND INDEED HE COMMONLY DOES BUT WITH A STILL LOWER DESCENT INTO THE LEVELS OF INDIGENTS AND ON THE MARGIN OF THE SLUMS THE MAN AND PRESENT LLE SO THE CHILDREN VIRTUALLY CEASED TO CONSUME VALLEY BULLETS FOR APPEARANCES AND THE WOMEN REMAINED'S VIRTUALLY THE SOLE EXPONENT OF THE SOLE EXPONENT OF THE SOLE EXPONENT OF THE SOLE EXPONENT OF THE SOLE EXPONENT OF THE SOLE EXPONENT OF THE SO EXPOSED PEUNIARY DECUNIARY DECUNIARY DECUNIARY DEC
949,VERY MUCH OF SQUALER AND DISCOMFET WILL BE ENDURED BEFORE THE LAST DRINKAGE OR THE LOST PRETENCE OF PECUNIARY DECENCY'S PUT AWAY
950,THERE IS NO CLASS IN NO COUNTRY THAT AS YIELDED SO OBJECTY BEFORE THE PRESSURE OF PHYSICAL WANT AS TO DENY THEMSELVES ALL GRATIFICATION OF THIS HIGHER OR SPIRITUAL NEED
951,THE QUESTIONOUS WHICH OF THE TWO METHODS WILL MOST EFFECTIVELY REACH THE PERSONS WHOSE CONVICTIONS IT IS DESIRED TO EFFECT
952,EACH WILL THERE FOR SERVE ABOUT EQUALLY WELL DURING THE ORDINARY STATE OF SOCIAL GROWTH
953,THE MODERN ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY WORKS IN THE SAME DIRECTION ALSO BY ANOTHER LINE
954,IT IS EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THE PRESENT FRIEND OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS IN THE DIRECTION OF HEIGHTENING THEIR TILLITY OF CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION AS COMPARED WITH MEASURE
955,IT IS ALSO NO DISABLED THAT THE SENSIBILITY CONSUMED AS A MEANS OF RETREAT AS WELL AS THE INSISTENCE ON IT AS AN ELEMENT OF DECENCY IS AT ITS BEST IN THOSE PORTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY WITH HUMAN CONTACT OF THE INDIVIDUALITY OF THE POPULATION IS GREATEST
956,FROM SOMETHING BECOMES A LARGE ELEMENT IN THE CENTER OF LIVING IN THE CITY ON IN THE COUNTRY
957,AMONG THE COUNTRY POPULATION ITS PLACES TO SOME EXTENT TAKEN BY SAVINGS AND HOME COMFORTS KNOWN THROUGH THE MEETING OF NEIGHBOR GUSTIC SUFFICIENT TO SERVE THE LIKE GENERAL PAIRS OF PECUNIARY REPUTE
958,HE RESOLVED HIS A GREAT ABILITY OF THE LABOUR EMPLOYED IN PRINTING PERHAPS GREATER THAN IN ANY OTHER EQUALLY WELL DEFINED INCONSIDERABLE BODY OF WORKMAN
959,UNDER THE SINGLE TEST OF EFFECTIVENESS FOR ADVERTISING WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND LEISURE AND THE CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION OF GOODS DIVIDING THE FIELD OF PECULIAR EMILATION PRE TO EVENLY BETWEEN THEM AT THE OUTSET
960,BUT THE ACTUAL COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THIS IDEAL SCHEME LEISURE HELD THE FIRST PACE AT THE STOPPED AND CAME TILL THE RANK FERMENT ABOVE WASTEFUL CONSUMPTION OF GOODS BOTH AS IT DIRECT EXPONENT OF WEALTH AND AS AN ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF DECENCY DURING THE COURSE I PEACEFUL CULTURE
961,OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE PERMITTING THAT INSTINCT DISPOSES MEN TO LOOK WITH FAVOR UPON PRODUCTIVE EFFICIENCY AND ON WHATEVER IS OF HUMAN USE
962,I RECONCIATION BETWEEN THE TWO CONFLICTING REQUIREMENTS IS AFFECTED BY RESORT TO MAKE BELIEVE MEN AN INTRICATE POLITE OF SERVICES AND SOCIAL JUDICUS OF A CEREMONIAL NATURE ARE DEVELOPED MANY ORGANISATIONS SUFFERED WITH SOME SPECIES OBJECT OF EMILIARATION AND A DEE OF THEIR TRAFFIC
963,THE SAME AND FEATURES OF THIS DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC SADNESS HAVE ALREADY BEEN INDICATED
964,THROUGH OUT THE ENTIRE EVOLUTION OF CONSPICUOUS EXPENDITURE WHETHER OF GOOD SIR OF SERVICES OR HUMAN LIFE RUNS THE OBVIOUS IMPICATION THAT IN ORDER TO EFFECTUALLY MEN THE CONSUM IS GOOD THING IT MUST BE AN EXPENDITURE OF SUPERFLUITIES
965,HAS USED IN THE SPEECH OF EVERYDAY LIFE THE WORD CARRIES AN UNDIS TONE OF DEPRECATION
966,THE USE OF THE WORD WASTE DOES A TECHNICAL TERMS THEREFORE IMPIES NO DEPRECATION OF THE MOTIVES OR OF THE UNS SALT BY THE CONCEALER UNDER THIS CANNON OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE
967,BUT IT IS ANOTHER GRUNT'S WORTH NOTING THAT THE TERM WASTE IN THE LANGUAGE OF EVERYDAY LIFE IMPLIES DEPRECATION OF WHAT IS CHARACTERIZED A SWASTFUL
968,INSTRAPPED ACCURACY NOTHING SHOULD BE INCLUDED UNDER THE HEAD OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE BUT SUCH EXPENDITURE AS HIS CONCURDE ON THE GROUND OF AN INDIVIDUAL COMPARISON
969,AND OUGHT TO THE MAYBE USEFUL AND WASTEFUL BOTH AND ITS CETILLATED TO CONCEAL HER MAY BE MADE UP OF USE AND WASTE IN THE MOST FIRING PROPORTIONS
970,AND OFTEN HAS MY MOTHER SAID WHILE ON HER LAP I LAID MY HEAD SHE FEARED FOR TIME I WAS NOT MADE BUT FOR ETERNITY
971,WHY ARE WE TO BE DENIED EACH OTHER SOCIETY
972,WHY ARE WE TO BE DIVIDED
973,JURELY IT MUST BE BECAUSE WE'RE IN DANGER OF LOVING UNTIL THEIR TOO WELL I'VE LOSING SAID OF THE CREATOR AND I DON'T YOU OF THE CREATURE
974,WE'D TO DISPUTE ABOUT MONTE CRISTO
975,SHE AT TORRENTING CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTER WAS ALWAYS IN A MINORITY OF ONE IN OUR HOUSE OF VIOLENT DESCENT AND RADICALISM
976,HER FEEBLE HEALTH GAVE HER HER HER YIELDING MANNER FOR SHE COULD NEVER OPPOSE ANY ONE WITHOUT GATHERING UP ALL HER STRENGTH FOR THE STRUGGLE
977,HE SPOKE FRENCH PERFECTLY I HAVE BEEN TOLD WHEN NEED WAS BUT DELIGHTED USUALLY IN TALKING THE BROADEST YEAR
978,AND SO LIFE AND DEATH HAVE DISPERSE THE CIRCLE OF VIOLENT RADICALS AND DISSENTERS INTO WHICH TWENTY YEARS AGO THE LITTLE QUIET RESOLUTE CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTER WAS RECEIVED AND BY WHOM SHE WAS TRULY LOVED AND HONOURED
979,JANUARY AND FEBRUARY OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN HAD PASSED AWAY AND STILL THERE WAS NO REPLY FROM THE SOUTHERN
980,I AM NOT DEPRECIATING IT WHEN I SAY THAT IN THESE TIMES IT IS NOT RARE
981,BUT IT IS NOT WITH A VIEW TO DISTINCTION THAT YOU SHOULD CULTIVATE THIS TALENT IF YOU CAN SELL YOUR OWN HAPPINESS
982,YOU WILL SAY THAT A WOMAN HAS NO NEED OF SUCH A CAUTION THERE CAN BE NO PERIL IN IT FOR HER
983,THE MORE SHE IS ENGAGED IN HER PROPER DUTIES THE LESS LEISURE WILL SHE HAVE FOR IT EVEN AS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT AND A RECREATION
984,TO THOSE DUTIES YOU HAVE NOT YET BEEN CALLED AND WHEN YOU ARE YOU WILL BE LESS EAGER FOR CELERY
985,BUT DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT I DISPARGED THE GIFT WHICH YOU POSSESS NOR THAT I WOULD DISCOUR'D YOU FROM EXERCISEING IT I ONLY RESORT YOU SO TO THINK OF IT AND SO TO USE IT AS TO RENDER IT CONDUCE IT TO YOUR OWN PERMANENT GOOD
986,FAIRE WELL MADAME

993,I CAREFULLY AVOID ANY APPEARANCE OF PREOCCATION AND ACCENT TRINITY WHICH MIGHT LEAD THOSE I LIVE AMONGST TO SUSPECT THE NATURE OF MY PURSUITS
994,I DON'T ALWAYS SUCCEED FOR SOMETIMES WHEN AM TEACHING OR SOWING I WOULD RATHER BE READING OR WRITING BUT I TRIED TO DENY MYSELF AND MY FATHER'S APPROBATION AMPLY REWARDED ME FOR THE PROVISION
995,I CAN I THINK YOU THIS INCIDENT I SUPPOSE WILL BE RENEWED NO MORE IF I LIVE TO BE AN OLD WOMEN I SHALL REMEMBER IT THIRTY YEARS HENCE AS A GREAT DREAM

998,CARCEWICK MARCH TWENTY SECOND EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN DEAR MADAME
999,YOU LETTER HAS GIVEN ME GREAT PLEASURE AND I SHOULD NOT FORGIVE MYSELF IF I DID NOT TELL YOU SO
1000,OF THIS SECOND LETTER ALSO SHE SPOKE AND TOLD ME THAT IT CONTAINED AN INVITATION FOR HER TO GOD SEE THE POET IF EVER SHE VISITED THE LAKES
1001,ON AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN SHE RITES
1002,COME COME I'M GETTING REALLY TIRED OF YOUR ABSENCE
1003,SATTERED AFTER SATURDAY COMES AROUND AND I CAN HAVE NO HOPE OF HEARING YOUR KNOCK OF THE DOOR AND THEN BEING TOLD THAT MISS HE HAS COME OH DEAR
1004,IN THIS MONOTONOUS LIFE AND MIND THAT WAS A PLEASANT EVENT
1005,I WAS YOU RECUR AGAIN BUT IT WILL TAKE TWO OR THREE INTERVIEWS BEFORE THE STIFFNESS TO THE ESTRANGEMENT OF THIS LONG SEPARATION WILL WEAR AWAY
1006,MY EYES FILLED CHEERS WHEN I CAN TRUST THE BLISS OF SUCH A STATE BRIGHTENED BY HOPES OF THE FUTURE WITH THE MELANCHOLY STATE I NOW LIVE IN UNCERTAIN THAT I EVER FELT TRUE CONTRITION IN THOUGHT AND DEED LONGING FOR HOLINESS WHICH I SHALL NEVER OBTAIN SNIT IN THAT TIMES TO THE HEART WITH THE HEART WITH THE CONVICTION THAT I SHALL NEVER OBTAININGNESS WHICH I SHALL NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER OBTAIN SNIG IN THAT TIMES TO THE HEART
1007,IF CHRISTIAN PERFECTION BE NECESSARY TO SALVATION I SHALL NEVER BE SAVED MY HEART IS A VERY HOT BED FOR SIMPLE THOUGHTS AND WHEN I DECIDE ON AN ACTION I SCARCELY REMEMBER TO LOOK TO MY ORDEEM OF HER OBJECTION
1008,AND MEANTIME I KNOW THE GREATNESS OF JEHOLA I ACKNOWLEDGE THE PERFECTION OF HIS WORD I ADORE THE PURITY OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH MY THEORY'S RIGHT MY PRACTICE HORRIBLY WRONG
1009,THE CHRISTMAS CAME AND SHE AND RETURNED TO THE PARSONAGE AND TO THAT HAPPY HOME CIRCLE IN WHICH ALONE THEIR NATURES EXPANDED AMONGST ALL OTHER PEOPLE THEY SHRIVELED ABOUT MORE OF US
1010,INDEED THERE WERE ONLY ONE OR TWO STRANGERS WHO COULD BE ADMITTED AMONG THE SISTERS WITHOUT PRODUCING THE SAME RESULT
1011,SHE WAS GONE OUT INTO THE VILLAGE ON SOME AIR AND WHEN AS SHE WAS DESCENDING THE STEEP STREET HER FOOT SLIPPED ON ICE AND SHE FELL HE WAS DARK AND GNAWANCE SAW HER MISS CHANCE TILL AFTER A TIME HER GROANS ATTRACTIVE THE ATTENTION OF HER PASSER BY
1012,UNFORTUNATELY THE FACTOR CANNOT BE SET TILL SIX O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING AS NO SURGEON WAS TO BE HAD BEFORE THAT TIME AND SHE NOW LIES AT HER HOUSE IN A VERY DOUBTFUL AND DANGEROUS STATE
1013,HOWEVER REMEMBERING WILL YOU TOLD ME NAMELY THAT YOU HAD COMMANDED THE MATTER TO HIGHER DECISION THAN OURS AND THAT YOU ARE RESOLVED TO SUBMIT WITH RESIGNATION TO THAT DECISION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE I HOLD IT MY DUTY TO YIELD ALSO AND MAY BE ALL FOR THE BEST
1014,AFTER THIS IS A PERSON I NEVER DARE RECKON WITH CERTAINTY ON THE ENDURABLE OF THE PLEASURE AGAIN IT SEEMS AS IF SOME FATALITY STOOD BETWEEN YOU AND ME
1015,I AM NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU AND YOU MUST BE KEPT FROM THE CONTAMINATION OF TWO INTIMATE SOCIETY
1016,A GOOD NEIGHBOUR OF THE BROADAYS A CLEVER INTELLIGENT YORKSHIRE WOMAN WHO KEEPS A DRUNKEN SHOP AND HALL WORTH AND FROM HER OCCUPATION HER EXPERIENCE IN EXCELLENT SENSE HOLDS THE POSITION A VILLAGE DOCTORS AND NURSE AND AS SUCH HAS BEEN A TIME OF TRIAL AND SICKNESS AND DEATH IN MANY A TIME OF TRIAL AND SICKNESS AND DEATH IN MANY A TIME OF TRIAL
1017,TAPPY HAD LIVED WITH THEM FOR TEN OR TWELVE YEARS AND WAS AS CHARLOTTE EXPRESSED IT ONE OF THE FAMILY
1018,HERE FEW'S AT FIRST TO LISTEN TO THE CAREFUL ADVICE HE WAS REPRIMINATE TO HIS LIBERAL NATURE
1019,THIS DECISION WAS COMMUNICATED TO THE GIRLS
1020,TAPPY HAD TENDED THEM IN THEIR CHILDHOOD THEY AND NONE OTHER SHE TENDED HER IN HER INFIRMITY IN AGE
1021,AT TEA TIME THEY WERE SAD AND SILENT AND THE MEAL WENT AWAY ON TOUCH BY ANY OF THE THREE
1022,SHE HAD ANOTHER WAIT ON HER MIND THIS CHRISTMAS
1023,BUT ANNE HAD BEGAN TO SUFFER JUST BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS AND CHARLOTTE WATCHED OVER HER YOUNGER SISTERS WITH THE JEALOUS VIGILANCE OF SOME WILD CREATURE THAT CHANGES HER VERY NATURE IF DANGEROUS HER YOUNG
1024,STUNG BY ANXIETY FOR THIS LITTLE SISTER SHE OPERATED MIST W FOR HER FANCY INDIFFERENCE TO UNSET OF HEALTH
1025,STILL HER HEART HAD RECEIVED A SHOCK IN THE PERCEPTION OF ENDS'S DELICACY AND ALL THESE HOLIDAY SHE WATCHED OVER HER WITH THE LONGING FINE ANXIETY WHICH A SO FULL OF SUDDEN THINGS OF FEAR
1026,I DON'T WHETHER BROWN WELL WAS MAINTAINING HIMSELF AT THIS TIME
1027,TO CELEBRATE THE ARRIVAL OF HER SON SYLVIA GAVE A SPLENDID SUPPER TO WHICH SHE HAD INVITED ALL HER RELATIVES AND IT WAS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO MAKE THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
1028,WITHOUT SAYING IT POSITIVELY SHE MADE ME UNDERSTAND THAT BEING HERSELF AND A LUSTROUS MEMBER OF THE REPUBLIC OF LETTERS SHE WAS WELL AWARE THAT SHE WAS SPEAKING TO AN INSECT
1029,IN ORDER TO PLEASE HER I SPOKE TO HER OF THE ABBEY CONE AND I HAD OCCASION TO QUOTE TWO LINES OF THAT PROFOUND WRITER
1030,MADAME CORRECTED ME WITH A PATRONIZING AIR FOR BY PRONUNCIATION OF THE WORD SCOWVA WHICH MEANS DIVIDED SAYING THAT IT OUGHT TO BE PRONOUNCED SKIRA AND SHE ADDED THAT I OUGHT TO BE VERY GLAD TO HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH ON THE FIRST DAY OF MY ARRIVAL IN PARIS TELLING ME THAT IT WOULD BE UNIN PARIS TELLING ME THAT IT WOULD BE UNIN PARIS
1031,HER FACE WAS IN A NICKMAH FOR IT INSPIRED EVERY ONE WITH THE WAREST SYMPATHY AND YET IF YOU EXAMINED IT ATTENTIVELY THERE WAS NOT ONE BEAUTIFUL FEATURE SHE COULD NOT BE CALLED HANDSOME BUT NO ONE COULD HAVE THOUGHT HER UGLY
1032,FILIA WAS THE ADORATION OF FRANCE AND HER TALENT WAS THE REAL SUPPORT OF ALL THE COMEDY'S WHICH THE GREATEST AUTHORS WROTE FOR HER ESPECIALLY OF THE PLAYS OF MAROVO FOR WITHOUT HER HIS COMBITIES WOULD NEVER HAVE GONE TO POSTERITY
1033,SYLVIA DID NOT THINK THAT HER GOOD CONDUCT WAS A MERIT FOR SHE KNEW THAT SHE WAS VIRTUOUS ONLY BECAUSE HERSELF LOVE COMPELLED HER TO BE SO AND SHE NEVER EXHIBITED ANY PRIDE OR ASSUMED ANY PRIDE OR THEIR BEAUTY THEY CARED LITTLE ABOUT RENDERING THEMSELVES CONSPICUOUS BY THEIR BEAUTY
1034,TWO YEARS BEFORE HER DEATH I SAW HER PERFORM THE CHARACTER OF MARIANNE IN THE REMEDY OF MARAVO AND IN SPITE OF HER AGE AND DECLINING HEALTH THE ILLUSION WAS COMPLETE
1035,SHE WAS HONORABLY BURIED IN THE CHURCH OF SAINTS OF ERROR WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST OPPOSITION FROM THE VENERABLE PRIEST WHO FAR FROM SHARING THE ANTI CHRISTIAN AND TOLERANCY OF THE CLERGY IN GENERAL SAID THAT HER PROFESSION AS AN ACTRESS HAD NOT HINDERED HER FROM BEING A GOOD CHRISTIAN AND THAT THE EARTH WAS A COMMON MOTHER OF ALL MANKIND
1036,YOU WILL FORGIVE ME DEAR READER IF I HAVE MADE YOU ATTEND THE FUNERAL OF SYLVIA TEN YEARS BEFORE HER DEATH BELIEVE ME I HAVE NO INTENTION OF PERFORMING THE MIRACLE YOU MAY CONSO YOURSELF WITH THE IDEA THAT I SHALL SPARE YOU THAT UNPLEASANT TASK WHEN POOR SYLVIA DIE'S
1037,I NEVER HAD ANY FAMILY
1038,I HAD A NAME I BELIEVE IN MY YOUNG DAYS BUT I HAVE FORGOTTEN IT SINCE I HAVE BEEN IN SERVICE
1039,I SHALL CALL YOU AS FREE
1040,YOU DO ME A GREAT HONOR
1041,HERE GO AND GET ME CHANGED FOR LILY I HAVE IT SIR
1042,AT JOVE SERVICE SIR
1043,MAD DOWN ONE SAW BESIDES CAN ANSWER YOUR INQUIRIES
1044,I SEE A QUANTITY OF CHAIRS FOR HIGHER AT THE RATE OF ONE'S SOU MEN READING THE NEWSPAPER UNDER THE SHADE OF THE TREES GIRLS AND MEN BREAKFASTING EITHER ALONE MORE IN COMPANY WAITERS WHO WERE RAPIDLY GOING UP AND DOWN AND NARROW STAIRCASE HIDDEN UNDER THE FOLIAGE
1045,I SIT DOWN IN A SMALL TABLE A RAIDER COMES IMMEDIATELY TO INQUIRE MY WISHES
1046,I CHAINED TO GIVE ME SOME COFFEE IF IT IS GOOD
1047,THEN TURNING TOWARDS ME HE SAYS THAT I LOOK LIKE A FOREIGNER AND WHEN I SAY THAT I AM AN ITALIAN HE BEGINS TO SPEAK TO ME OF THE CORPS THE CITY OF THE THEATRES AND AT LAST HE OFFERS TO ACCOMPANY ME EVERYWHERE
1048,I THANKED HIM AND TAKE MY LEAVE
1049,I ADDRESS HIM IN ITALIAN AND HE ANSWERS VERY WIDILY BUT HIS WAY OF SPEAKING MAKES ME SMILE AND I TELL HIM WHY
1050,MY MARK PLACES HIM BUT I SOON PROVED TO HIM THAT IT IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO SPEAK HOWEVER PERFECT MAY HAVE BEEN THE LANGUAGE OF THAT ANCIENT WRITER
1051,I SEE A CROWD IN ONE CORNER OF THE GARDEN EVERYBODY STANDING STILL AND LOOKING UP
1052,IS THERE NOT A ALREADY IN EVERYWHERE
1053,YES BUT THE MERIDIAN OF THE PALAISO IS THE MOST EXACT
1054,THAT IS TRUE BADGERIE
1055,ALL THESE HONEST PERSONS ARE WAITING THEIR TURN TO GET THEIR SNUFF BOXES FILLED
1056,IT IS SO EVERYWHERE BUT FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS NOBODY WILL USE ANY SNUFF BUT THAT SOLD AT THE EVENT CAT
1057,IS IT BETTER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE
1058,BUT TO HOW DID SHE MANAGED TO RENDER IT SO FASHIONABLE
1059, SIMPLY ICE TALKING HER CARRIAGE TWO OR THREE TIMES BEFORE THE SHOP TO HAVE HURST MUFF BOX FILLED AND BY SAYING ALOUD TO THE YOUNG GIRL WHO HANDED BACK THE BOX THAT HURST MUFF WAS THE VERY BEST IN PARIS
1060,YOU ARE NOW AND THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHERE WIT CAN MAKE A FORTUNE BY SELLING EITHER A GENUINE OR OF FALSE ARTICLE IN THE FIRST CASE IT RECEIVED THE WELCOME OF INTELLIGENT PEOPLE AND IN THE SECOND FOOLS ARE ALWAYS READY TO REWARD IT MAY APPEAR AND IN THE SECOND FOOLS ARE ALWAYS READY TO REWARD IT MAY APPEAR AND IN THE SECOND
1061,LET A MAN RUN AND EVERYBODY WILL RUN AFTER HIM THE CROWD WILL NOT STOP UNLESS THE MAN IS PROVED TO BE MAD BUT TO PROVE IT IS INDEED DIFFICULT TASK BECAUSE WE HAVE A CROWD OF MEN WHO MAD FROM THEIR BIRTH ARE STILL CONSIDERED WISE
1062,IT SEEMS TO ME I REPLIED THAT SUCH APPROVAL SUCH RATIFICATION OF THE OPINION EXPRESSED BY THE KING THE PRINCES OF THE BLOOD ET CETERA IS RATHER REPROOF OF THE AFFECTION FELT FOR THEM BY THE NATION FOR THE FRENCH CARRY THAT AFFECTION TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THEY BELIEVE THEM AND FOUL
1063,WHEN THE KING COMES TO PARIS EVERYBODY CALLS OUT VIEW WHO'LL LIE
1064,SHE INTRODUCED ME TO ALL HER GUESTS AND GAVE ME SOME PARTICULAR'S RESPECTING EVERY ONE OF THEM
1065,WHAT SIR I SAID TO HIM AND MY FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO SEE YOU
1066,HE HIMSELF RECITE AT THE SAME PASSAGE AND FRENCH AND POLITELY POINTED OUT THE PARTS IN WHICH HE THOUGHT THAT I HAD IMPROVED ON THE ORIGINAL
1067,FOR THE FIRST DAY SIR I THINK THAT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE GIVES GREAT HOPES OF YOU AND WITHOUT ANY DOUBT YOU WILL MAKE RAPID PROGRESS
1068,I BELIEVE IT SIR AND THAT IS WHAT I FEAR THEREFORE THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT OF MY VISIT HERE IS TO DEVOTE MYSELF ENTIRELY TO THE STUDY OF THE FRIEND LANGUAGE
1069,I AM A VERY UNPLEASANT PUPIL ALWAYS ASKING QUESTIONS CURIOUS TROUBLESOME INSATIABLE AND EVEN SUPPOSING THAT I COULDN'T MEET WITH THE TEACHER I REQUIRE I AM AFRAID I AM NOT RICH ENOUGH TO PAY HIM
1070,I RAISED I'D IN THE VALET GREW DEAD'S PORT
1071,I WILL MAKE YOU TRANSLATE THEM INTO FRENCH AND YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID OF MY FINDING YOU SENSATIONAL
1072,HE HAD A GOOD APPETITE COULD TELL A GOOD STORY WITHOUT LAUGHING WITH CELEBRATED FOR HIS WITTY ROBERTS AND HIS SOCIABLE MANNERS BUT HE SPENT HIS LIFE AT HOME SELDOM GOING OUT AND SEEING HARDLY ANY ONE BECAUSE HE ALWAYS HAD A PIP IN HIS MOUTH AND WAS SURROUNDED BY AT LEAST TWENTY CATS WITH WHICH HE WOULD AMUSE
1073,HIS HOUSEKEEPER HAD THE MANAGEMENT OF EVERYTHING SHE NEVER ALLOWED HIM TO BE IN NEED OF ANYTHING AND SHE GAVE NO ACCOUNT OF HIS MONEY WHICH SHE KEPT ALTOGETHER BECAUSE HE NEVER ASKED HER TO RENDER ANYTHING ACCOUNTS
1074,ON THE SIXTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN THIRTY THE CHURCH OF JESUS PRICE OF LATTER DAY STATES WAS FORMERLY ORGANIZED AND THUS TOOK ON A LEGAL EXISTENCE
1075,ITS ORIGIN WAS SMALL ADJOURM AN INSIGNIFICANT SEED HARDLY TO BE THOUGHT OF AS LIKELY TO AROUSE OPPOSITION
1076,INSTEAD OF BUT SIX REGULARLY EILLATED MEMBERS AND AT MOST TWO SQUARE OF ADHERENTS THE ORGANIZATION NUMBERS TO DAY MANY HUNDRED THOUSAND SOULS
1077,IN PLACE HAVE A SINGLE HAMLET IN THE SMALLEST CORNER OF WHICH THE MEMBERS COULD HAVE CONGREGATED THEIR NAIL ARE ABOUT SEVENTY STATES OF ZION AND ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED ORGANIZED WORDS EACHWARD AND STAKE WITH ITS FULL COMPLIMENT OF OFFICERS AND PRECEDED ORGANIZATIONS
1078,THE PRACTICE OF GATHERING ITS PROSEILLITES INTO ONE PLACE PREVENTS THE BUILDING UP AND STRENGTHENING AFFORD BRANCHES AND INASMUCH AS EXTENSIVE AND STRONG ORGANISATIONS ARE SELDOM MET WITH A BROAD VERY ERRONEOUS IDEA'S EXIST CONCERNING THE STRENGTH OF THE CHURCH
1079,NEVER LESS OF THE MUSTERED SEAT AMONG THE SMALLEST OF ALL SEEDS HAS ATTAINED THE PROPORTIONS OF A TREE AND THE BIRDS OF THE AIR ARE NESTING IN ITS BRANCHES THE ACORN IS NOW IN OPEN OFFERING PROTECTION AND THE STREETS OF SATISFACTION TO EVERY ARTIST
1080,THEIR EYES WERE FROM THE FIRST TURNED IN ANTICIPATION TOWARD THE EVENING SUM NOT MERELY THAT THE WORK OF PROSELLEITY SHOULD BE CARRIED ON IN THE WEST BUT THAT THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE CHURCH SHOULD BE THERE ESTABLISHED
1081,THE BOOK A MOMENT HAD TAUGHT THE PEOPLE THE TRUE ORIGIN AND DESTINY OF THE AMERICAN INDIANS AND TO ONE OF THIS DARK SKINNED REMNANT OF A ONCE MIGHTY PEOPLE THE MISSIONARIES OF MORMONISM EARLY TURNED THEIR EYES WINTER THEIR HEARTS AND THEIR HEARTS AND THEIR HOPES
1082,IT IS NOTABLE THAT THE INDIAN TRIBES HAVE FEARLY REGARDED THE RELIGION OF THE LATTER DAY SATES WITH FAVOR SEEING IN THE LOCAL WOMAN STRIKING AGREEMENT WITH THEIR OWN TRADITIONS
1083,THE FIRST WELL ESTABLISHED SEAT OF THE CHURCH WAS IN THE PRETTY LITTLE TOWN OF CURLAND OHIO ALMOST WITHIN SIGHT OF LIGHT ERIE AND HERE SOON ROSE THE FIRST TEMPLE OF MODERN TIMES
1084,TO THE SERVANT LATTER'S SAKE A TEMPLE IS NOT SIMPLY A CHURCH BUILDING A HOUSE VIRULID USE ASSEMBLY
1085,SOON THOUSANDS OF COVERS HAD RENTED OR PURCHASED TOONES AND MISERY A DEPENDENCE JACKSON COUNTY BEING THEIR CENTER BUT FROM THE FIRST THAT THEY WERE UNPOPOTULAR AMONG THE MISERIANS
1086,THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR LULL BRING W BOGS AFTER OUR GOVERNOR WAS A PRONOUNCED WARMAN HAYRE AND THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD OF THE TROUBLES HE MANIFESTED IS SYMPATHY WITH THE PERSECUTIONS
1087,THEIR SUFFERINGS HAVE NEVER YET BEEN FIDDLY CHRONICLED BY HUMAN SCRIBE
1088,MAKING THAT WAY ACROSS THE RIVER MOST OF THE REFUGEES FOUND SHELTER AMONG THE MORE HOSPITAL PEOPLE OF CLAY COUNTY AND AFTERWARD ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES AND CALLED WELL COUNTY THEY WENT STARTING THE CITY OF OUR WEST
1089,A SMALL SETTLED HAD BEEN FOUNDED BY MORMON FAMILIES ON SHORE CREEK AND HERE ON THE THIRTIETH OF OCTOBER EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT A COMPANY OF TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FELL UPON THE HAPPEL OF SETTLERS AND WHICH HEARD A SCORE
1090,BE IT SAID IN THE HONOR OF SOME OF THE OFFICERS ENTRUSTED WITH A TERRIBLE COMMISSION THAT WHEN THEY ALERT ITS TRUE SIGNIFICANCE THEY RESIGNED THEIR AUTHORITY RATHER THAN HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT THEY DESIGNATED A COLD BLOODED BUTCHERY
1091,OH WHAT ARE RECORD TO READ WHAT A PICTURE DE GAZE UPON HOW AWFUL THE FACT
1092,A AMERICANS SCHOOL BOYS READ WITH EMOTIONS OF HORROR OF THE ALBIGANCES DRIVEN BEATEN AND KILLED WITH A PAPAL LEGATE DIRECTING THE BUTCHERY AND OF THE FOT LAW HUNTED AND HOW DO LIKE BEATS AS THE FACT OF A WORLD DECREE
1093,WHO BEGAN THE QUARREL WAS AT THE MORLANDS
1094,AS THE STABLE OF THE PRESS COMMENTS AGAINST AT THE BRUTALITY OF THE MISERIANS I QUOTE A PARAGRAPH FROM THE QUINCEY ARGUS MARCH SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE
1095,IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT AN ORGANIZED MOB AIDED BY MANY OF THE CIVIL AND MILITARY OFFICERS OF MISERY WITH GOVERNOR BOBS AT THEIR HEAD HAVE BEEN THE PROMINENT ACTORS IN THIS BUSINESS IN SIGHTING TWO IT APPEARS AGAINST THE MORMONS BY POLITICAL HATRED AND BY THE ADDITIONAL HATRED AND BY THE ADDITIONAL HATRED
1096,DAR ME FOUND THE PEOPLE IN POVERTY AND LEFT THEM IN COMPARATIVE WEALTH
1097,BUT A WORD FURTHER CONCERNING THE EXPEDITION IN GENERAL
1098,IT WAS THROUGH VOIDZ HAD VIDES THE DECATED ORDER THE MILITARY EXPEDITION TO UTOP HOSTENSIVELY TO INSTALL CERTAIN FEDERAL OFFICIALS AND TWO REPRESS AN ALLEGED IN FANTASTIC IN FANTASTIC OUR VALUE WHICH IN FACT HAD NEVER COME INTO EXISTENCE BUT IN REALITY TO FURTHER THE INTRIGUES OF THE SUSSEENISTS
1099,MOREOVER HAD THE PEOPLE BEEN INCLINED TO REBELLION WHILE GREATER OPPORTUNITY COULD THEY HAVE WISHED
1100,ALREADY AND NORTH AND THE SOUTH WERE TALKATIVE ONE NOT SET UP POSSIBLE WEST
1101,THEY KNEW NO NORTH DO SOUTH THOUGH EAST NO WEST THEY SAID POSITIVELY BY THE CONSTITUTION AND WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO IN THE BLOODY STRIFE BETWEEN BROTHERS UNLESS INDEED THEY WERE SUMMONED BY THE AUTHORITY TO WHICH THEY HAD ALREADY ONCE LOYALLY RESPONDED TO FURNISH MEN IN ARMS THE COUNTRY'S NEED
1102,WHAT THE LATTER ESSAYEDS ALSO LESS TILL MARRIAGE IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE CHURCH AND USING VERY GENERAL PRACTICE BUT OF SO AS TO MARRIAGE A REALITY OF WIVES WAS AN INCIDENT NEVER AN ESSENTIAL
1103,WE BELIEVE IT A LITTLE RESURRECTION AND AN ACTUAL HEREAFTER IN WHICH FUTURE STATE SHALL BE RECOGNIZED EVERY SANCTIFIED IT AUTHORIZED RELATIONS SHOULD EXISTING HERE ON EARTH OF PARENT AND CHILD BROTHER AND SISTER HUSBAND AND WIFE
1104,IT HAS BEEN MY PRIVILEGE TO TREAD THE SOIL OF MANY LANCE TO OBSERVE THE CUSTOMS AND STUDY THE HABITS OF MORE NATIONS THAN ONE AND I YET TO FIND THEIR PLACE AND MEET THE PEOPLE WHERE AND WITH WHOM THE PURITY OF MAN AND WOMAN IS HELD MORE PRECIOUS THAN AMONG THE ALLIED MORMONS IN THE MALIGNES
1105,AT THE IN SECTION OF PEARL MARRIAGE AMONG THE LATTER STATES THERE WAS NO LAW NATIONAL OR STATE AGAINST ITS PRACTICE
1106,IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO A LAW WAS A NIGHTY WITH A PURPOSE OF SUPPRESSING MORAL MARRIAGE AND AS HAD BEEN PREDICTED IN THE NATIONAL HEADED PRAYER TO ITS PASSAGE AND LAY FROM MANY YEARS AT DEAD LETTER
1107,FEBRUARY JUDGES AND UNITED STATES AT TURTIES IN UTAH WHO WERE NOT WARMONS NOR LOVERS HAVE MORBIDISM REFUSED TO ENTERTAIN THEM PLATES OR PROSECUTE CASES UNDER THE LAW BECAUSE OF ITS MANIFEST INJUSTICE AND INADEQUACY
1108,THIS BED THAT FOR AN ALLEGED MISTED MEANER FOR WHICH CONGRESS PRESCRIBED A MAXIMUM PEDILITY OF SIX MONTHS IMPRISONMENT IN A FINE OF THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MAN MIGHT BE A PRISON FOR LIFE I FOR MANY TERMS OF IMMENSE NATURAL LIFE TO THE QUARTS POWER TO ENFORCE ITS DENSE SO FAR TO ENFORCE ITS DENSE SO FAR TO ENFORCE ITS DENSE SO FAR TO ENFORCE ITS DENSE SO FAR TO ENFORCE ITS DENSE SO FAR TO ENFORCE ITS DENSE SO FAR TO ENFORCE ITS DENS SO FAR TO ENFORCEDURE LIFE
1109,BEFORE THIS MAJESTY ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF LAW COULD BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURT OF LAST RESORT AND THERE MET WITH THE REVERSAL AND REBUKE IT DESERVED MEN WHERE A PRESENT UNDER SENTENCE OF MANY YEARS DERATION
1110,THE PEOPLE CONTESTED THESE MEASURES ONE BY ONE IN THE COURTS PRESENTING IN CASE AFTER CASE THE DIFFERENT PHASES OF THE SUBJECT AND URGING THE UNACCUSTOMEDITY OF THE MEASURE
1111,THEN THE CHURCH WAS DISENCOURATED AND ITS ROBBERABLE REAL AND PERSONAL CONFISCATED AND DISHEATED TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND ALTHOUGH THAT PERSONAL PROPERTY WAS SOON RESTORED REALISEDATE OF GREAT VALUE LONG LAY IN THE HANDS OF THE COURTS RECEIVER AND THE MORCERFOUR AND THE MORCERFINGER
1112,AND SO THE STORY OF MOMENT IS A RUNS ON ITS PHENOMENON HAS NOT YET BEEN WRITTEN THE CURRENT PRESS PRESERVES CONTINUALLY NEW STAGES OF ITS PROGRESS NEW DEVELOPMENT OF ITS PLAN
1113,MATE HOME LIKE ALEXANDER BE COSY WAS AN ENGINEER
1114,HE HAD FREQUENTLY IDEAS ABOUT EVERYTHING AND HIS IDEA ABOUT AMERICANS WAS THAT THEY SHOULD BE ENGINEERS AND A CARRIAGE
1115,IT'S TREMENDOUSLY MILK PUT ON TOO
1116,IT'S BEEN ON ONLY TWO WEEKS AND I'VE BEEN HALF A DOZEN TIMES ALREADY
1117,D'YOU KNOW ALEXANDER MAY HOLLOW LOOK WITH PERPLEXITY UP INTO THE TOP OF THE HANDSOME AND RUBBED HIS PINK CHEEK WHICH WAS GLOVED FINGER DO YOU KNOW I SOMETIMES THINK OF TAKING TO CRITICISM'S REMARK THOU
1118,SHE SAGE HER HAND TOO SHE'S GOT HER BEST IN THE SECOND ROOM
1119,HE'S BEEN WANTING IN THREE YEARS AND MOOR
1120,SHE DOESN'T TAKE UP WITH ANYBODY YOU KNOW
1121,I REMEMBER GOING ONE OF HER FAMILY TOLD ME IN CONFIDENCE THAT THERE WAS A ROMANCE SOMEWHERE BACK IN THE BEGINNING
1122,MADE HULLBOWED FOR HER CONSTANCY WITH A LOCKINESS THAT MADE ALEXANDER SMILE EVEN WELL A KIND OF RAPID EXCITEMENT WAS TINGLING THROUGH HIM
1123,HE'S ANOTHER WHO WAS AWFULLY KEEN ABOUT HER LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
1124,SIR HARRY TOWN MISTER BARDERBERRY ALEXANDER THE AMERICAN ENGINEER
1125,I SAY SAID HARRY THE LITTLE GIRLS GOING FAMOUSLY TO NIGHT ISN'T SHE
1126,YOU KNOW I THOUGHT THE DANCE A BIG CONSCIOUS TO NIGHT BUT A FIRST TIME
1127,WHILST ME AND I WON'T BACK AFTER THE FIRST ACT AND WE THOUGHT SHE SEEMED QUITE UNCERTAIN OF HERSELF
1128,A LITTLE ATTACK OF NERVES POSSIBLY
1129,IT WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL OF KEEN INTEREST IN THE SLENDER BARE FOOT DON QUIXOTE GIRL WHO SLIPPED IN AND OUT OF THE PLAY SINGING LIKE SOME ONE WHINING THROUGH A NEWLY FIELD
1130,ONE NIGHT WHEN HE AND WHITTAKER WERE SITTING TOGETHER ON THE BRIDGE HE TOLD THAT THE THINGS HAD HAPPENED WHILE HE WAS STUDYING ABROAD THAT HE WAS SORRY FOR ONE BEING IN PARTICULAR AND HE ASKED HER WHETHER SHE THOUGHT SHE OUGHT TO KNOW ABOUT THEM
1131,SHE CONSIDERED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SAID NO I THINK NOT THE WAY AM GLAD YOU ASK ME
1132,AFTER THAT IT WAS EASY TO REGARD ACTUALLY TO FORGOT
1133,OF COURSE HE REFLECTED SHE ALWAYS HAD THAT COMBINATION OF SOMETHING ONLY INSENSIBLE AND SOMETHING UTTERLY WILD AND DEAF
1134,SHE MUST CARE ABOUT THE THEATRE A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN SHE USED TO
1135,I'M GLAD SHE'S HELD HER OWN SENSE
1136,AFTER ALL WE WERE AWFULLY LONG
1137,I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF SHE COULD LAUGH ABOUT IT WITH MORE
1138,HILDA WAS VERY NICE TO HIM AND HE SAT ON THE EDGE OF HIS CHAIR FLUSHED WITH HIS CONVERSATIONAL EFFORTS AND MOVING HIS CHIN ABOUT NERVOUSLY OVER HIS HIGH COLLAR
1139,THEY ASKED HIM TO COME TO SEE THEM AND JEALOUSY AND THEY SPOKE VERY TENDERLY OF HELVET
1140,LAYAM WOULDN'T CARE A GREAT DEAL ABOUT MANY OF THEM I FANCY
1141,WHEN PARTLY ARRIVED A BIT FOR SQUARE ON SUNDAY EVENING OR READ THE PRETTY LITTLE FRENCH GIRL MET HIM AT THE DOOR AND CONDUCTED HIM UP STAIRS
1142,I SHOULD NEVER HAVE ASKED YOU IF MOLLIE HAD BEEN HERE FOR I REMEMBER YOU DON'T LIKE A ENGLISH COOKERY
1143,I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE GET TO TELL YOU WHAT A JOLLY LITTLE PLACE I THINK THIS IS
1144,THEY ARE ALL SKETCHES MADE ABOUT THE BILLADESTA YOU SEE
1145,THOSE FELLOWS ARE ALL VERY OIL EVEN MAINH

1219,DON'T CRY DON'T CRY HE WHISPERED
1220,WITH TORTURED EACH OTHER ENOUGH FOR TO NIGHT
1221,CHAPTER ONE OR ITCHING
1222,IT IN GENDORS A WHOLE WORLD LOVE HEDGER FOR WHICH REDFT AND A HELL LAW PIGREN FOR WHICH RED HUNGER
1223,THUS I DON'T MISS IS THE MOTHER
1224,SHE HAS A SON FATHED IN A DOCTOR HUNGER
1225,WHAT IS SLANG
1226,WE HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THIS SORT OF OBJECTIONS
1227,SLANG IS ODIOUS
1228,SLAYING MAKES ONE SHUDDER
1229,WHO DIES THAT OF COURSE IT DOES
1230,WHEN IT IS A QUESTION OF PROBING A WOUND A GULF A SOCIETY SINCE WHEN HAS IT BEEN CONSIDERED WRONG TO GO TOO FAR TO GO TO THE BOTTOM
1231,WE HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT IT WAS SOMETIMES A COURAGEOUS ACT AND AT LEAST A SIMPLE AND USEFUL DEED WORTHY OF THE SYMPATHETIC ATTENTION WHICH DUTY ACCEPTED IN FULFILLED MERITS
1232,WHY SHOULD ONE NOT EXPORT EVERYTHING AND STUDY EVERYTHING
1233,WHY SHOULD ONE HALT ON THE WAY
1234,NOTHING IS MORE LUGUBRIOUS THAN THE CONTEMPLATION THUS IN ITS UNITY IN THE BROAD LIGHT OF THOUGHT OF THE HORRIBLE SWARMING OF SLANG
1235,NOW WHEN NOT HAS OR EVER EXCLUDED STUDY
1236,SINCE WHEN HAS MALADY BANISHED MEDICINE
1237,CAN ONE IMAGINE AN NATURALIST REFUSING TO STUDY THE HYPER THE BAD THE SCORPION THE CENTIPEDE THE TORANUELA AND ONE WHO WHICH CAST THEM BACK INTO THEIR DARKNESS SAYING OH HOW UGLY THAT IS
1238,HE WOULD BE LIKE AOLOGIST REFUSING TO EXAMINE A FACT IN LANGUAGE A PHILOSOPHER HESITATING TO DISCRIMARIES A FACT IN HUMANITY
1239,WHAT IS SLANG PROPERLY SPEAKING
1240,IT IS THE LANGUAGE OF WRETCHEDNESS
1241,WE MAY BE STOPPED THE FACT MAY BE PUT TO US IN GENERAL TERMS WHICH IS ONE WAY OF ATTENDED IT WE MAY BE TOLD THAT ALTERATES PROFESSIONS IT MAY BE ADDED ALL THE ACCIDENTS OF THE SOCIAL HIERARCHIANS OF THE SOCIAL HIERARCHIANS OF THE SOCIAL HIERARCHIAN
1242,THE PAINTER WHO SAYS MY GRANDER THE NOTARY WHO SAYS MY SKIP OF THE GUNTER THE HAND TREASURE WHO SAYS MY NEWLY BACK THE COBLER WHO SAYS MY CUB TALKS SLANG
1243,THERE IS THE SLANG OF THE AFFECTED LADY AS WELL AS OF THE PRESUSES
1244,THE SUGAR MANUFACTUREDR WHO SAYS LOVE CLAIRFIED LUMPS BASTARD COMMON BIRD THIS HONEST MANUFACTURER TALK SLAIN
1245,DON'T YO BRENDERSON BOTENY HOW VOTINE
1246,TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THIS CONFLICT WRETCHEDNESS HAS INVENTED A LANGUAGE OF COME THAT WHICH IS SLAIN
1247,TO KEEP A FLOAT AND TO RESCUE FROM OBLIVION TO HOLD ABOVE THE GULF WHERE IT BUT A FRAGMENT OF SOME LANGUAGE WHICH MEN HAS SPOKEN AND WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE BE LOST THAT IS TO SAY ONE OF THE ELEMENTS
1248,FINATION VERY GOOD
1249,EVEN DILEA LIT THAT PASS
1250,TO THIS WE REPLY AND ONE WORD ONLY
1251,A SURELY IF THE TONGUE WHICH A PROVINCE HAS SPOKEN IS WORTHY OF INTEREST THE LANGUAGE WHICH HAS BEEN SPOKEN BY A MISERY IS STILL MORE WORTHY OF ATTENTIONANCE STUDY
1252,AND THEN WE INSIST UPON IT THE STUDY OF SOCIAL DEFORMITY YOU AND INFIRMITIES AND THE TASK OF POINTING THEM OUT WITH A VIEW TO REMEDY IS NOT A BUSINESS IN WHICH TRACES PERMITTED
1253,HE MUST DESCEND WITH HIS HEART FULL OF CHERITY AND SEVERITY AT THE SAME TIME AS A BROTHER AND AS A JUDGE TWO THOSE IMPENETRABLE CASEMATES WERE CRAWL COW NOW THOSE WHO DEEDS IN THOSE WHO DEEDS IN THOSE WHO DEEDS IN THOSE WHO DEEDS IN THOSE WHO DEEDS IN THOSE WHO DEEDS IN THOSE WHO DEEDS IN THOSE WHO DEEDS IN THOSE WHO DEEDS IN THOSE WHO DEEDS IN THOSE WHO DEEDS IN THOSE WHO DEEDS IN THOSE WHO DEEDS IN THOSE WHO DEEDS IN THOSE WHO DEEDS IN THOSE WHO DEEDS IN THOSE WHO DEEDS IN THOSE WHO DEEDS IN THOSE WHO DEEDS IN THOSE WHO DEEDS IN THOSE WHO
1254,DO WE REALLY KNOW THE MOUNTAIN WELL WHEN WE ARE NOT ACQUAINTED WITH THE CATHERINE
1255,THEY CONSTITUTE TWO DIFFERENT ORDERS OF FACTS WHICH CORRESPOND TO EACH OTHER WHICH ARE ALWAYS INTERLACED AND WHICH OFTEN BRING FORTH RESULTS
1256,TRUE HISTORY BEING A MIXTURE OF ALL THINGS THE TRUE HISTORY AND MINGLES IN EVERYTHING
1257,FAX FOR ONE OF THESE AND IDEAS THE OTHER
1258,THERE IT CLOTHES ITSELF AND WORD MOSQUES IN MUCH OF FOUR RAGS
1259,IN THE SKIES IT BECOMES HORRIBLE
1260,ONE PROCEEDS WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING IT A HIDEOUS MURMUR STANDING ALMOST LIKE HUMAN ACTS AND MORE NEARLY RESEMBLING A HOWL THAN AN PARTICULAR WORD
1261,ONE THINKS ONE YEARS HIDING
1262,IT IS UNINTELLIGIBLE IN THE DARK
1263,IT IS BLACK IN MISFORTUNE IT IS BLACK OR STILL AND CRIME THESE TWO BLACKNESSES AMALGAMATED CUMBO'S SLANG
1264,THE EARTH IS NOT A VOID OF RESEMBLANCE TO A JAIL
1265,LOOK CLOSELY AT LIFE
1266,IT IS SO MEAN THAT EVERYWHERE WE FEEL THE SENSE OF PUNISHMENT
1267,EACH DAY HAS ITS OWN GREAT GRIEF FOR IT'S LITTLE CARE
1268,YES TO DAY YOU WERE TREMBLING FREE HEALTH IT IS DEAR TO YOU TO DAY YOU FEAR FOR YOUR OWN TO MORROW IT WILL BE ANXIETY ABOUT MONEY THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW THE DIATRIBE OF A LANDER THE DAY AFTER THAT THE MISFORTUNE OF SOME FRIEND THEN THE MISFORTUNE OF SOME FRIEND THE DAY AFTER THAT THE MISFORTUNE OF SOME FRIEND
1269,THIS WITHOUT RECKONING IN THE PAINS OF THE HEART AND SO TO GOES ON
1270,THERE IS HARDLY ONE DAY OUT OF A HUNDRED WHICH IS WHOLLY JOYOUS AND SUNNY
1271,AND YOU BELONG TO THAT SMALL CLASS WHO ARE UNHAPPY
1272,IN THIS WORLD'S EVIDENTLY THE VESTIBULE OF ANOTHER THERE ARE NO FORTUNATE
1273,THE REAL HUMAN DIVISION IS THIS THE LUMINOUS AND THE SHADY
1274,TO DIMINISH THE NUMBER OF THE SHADY TO AUGMENT THE NUMBER OF THE LUMINOUS THAT IS THE OBJECT
1275,THAT IS WHY WE CRIED EDUCATION
1276,TO TEACH READING MEANS TO LIKE THE FIRE EVERY SYMBOLS FILED OUT SPARKLES
1277,HOWEVER HE WHO SAYS LIGHT DOES NOT NECESSARILY SAY JOY
1278, PEOPLE SUFFER IN THE LIGHT EXCESS BURNS
1279,THE FINEST THE ENEMY OF THE WING
1280,TO BURN WITHOUT CEASING TO FLY THERE IN LIES THE MARVEL OF GENIUS
1281,YOU'LL NEVER DICK IT OUT OF THE AFTER LIBRARY
1282,TO THE YOUNG AMERICAN HERE WERE ELSEWHERE THE PATS OF FORTUNE ARE A NUMEROUS AND ALL OPEN THERE IS INVITATION IN THE AIR AND SUCCESS IN ALL HIS WIDE HORIZON
1283,HE HAS NO CONDITIONS TO BIND HIM OR GUIDE HIM AND HIS IMPULSE IS TO BREAK AWAY FROM THE OCCUPATION HIS FATHER HAS FOLLOWED AND MAKE A NEW WAY FOR HIMSELF
1284,THE MODEST FELLOW WOULD HAVE LIKED TO VAIN FIRST UPON HIM FOR SOME WORTHY ACHIEVEMENT IT MIGHT BE FOR A BOOK OR FOR THE SKILLFUL MANAGEMENT OF SOME GREAT NEWSPAPER OR FOR SOME DARING EXPEDITION LIKE THAT OF LIEUTENANT STRAIN OR DOCTOR KANE
1285,HE WAS UNABLE TO DECIDE EXACTLY WHAT IT BE
1286,SOMETIMES HE THOUGHT HE WOULD LIKE TO STAND IN A CONSPICUOUS PULPIT AND HUMBLY PREACHED THE GOSPEL OF APPENDENTS AND IT EVEN CROSS'S MIND THAT IT WOULD BE NOBLE THEY GIVE HIMSELF TO A MISSIONARY LIGHT TO SOME BENIGHTED REGION WHERE THE DATE POND GROWS
1287,WHILE SEEMED TO HIM WELL ENOUGH AS HIS SCIENCE BUT HE NEVER COULD DISCOVER A PRACTICAL CASE WHERE IT APPEARED TO HIM WORTH WILD GO TO LAW AND ALL THE CLIENT WHO STOPPED WITH THIS NEW CLERK AND THE ANTI ROOM OF THE LAW HOPS WHERE HE WAS WRITING THOUGH EVEN VERILY ADVISED TO SETTLE NO MATTER HOW BUT SETTLE NO MATTER HOW BUT SETTLE NO MATTER HOW BUT SETTLE NO MATTER HOW BUT SETTLE NO MATTER HOW BUT SETTLE NO MATTER HOW BUT SETTLE NO MATTER HOW BUT SETTLE NO MATTER HOW BUT SETTLE NO MATTER HOW BUT SETTLE NO MATTER HOW BUT SETTLE NO MATTER HOW BUT SETTLE NO MATTER HOW BUT SETTLE NO MATTER
1288,IT IS SUCH A NOBLE AMBITION THAT IT IS A PITY IT HAS USUALLY SUCH A SHALLOW FOUNDATION
1289,HE WANTED TO BEGIN AT THE TOP OF THE WATER
1290,THOUGH UP THEREFORE RED DILIGENTLY IN THE AFTER LIBRARY LAND LITERARY WORKS THAT SHOULD COMPEL ATTENTION AND NURSED HIS GENIUS
1291,HE HAD NO FRIEND WISE ENOUGH TO TELL HIM TO SET INTO THE DARK AND CONVICTION THEN IN SESSION MAKE A SKETCH OF THE MEN AND WOMEN ON THE PLATFORM AND TAKE IT TO THE EDITORS OF THE DAILY GRAVE LINE AND SEE WHAT HE COULD GET A LINE FOR IT
1292,OH VERY WELL SAID BRING OUT TURNING AWAY WITH A SHADE OF CONTEMPT YOU'LL FIND IF YOU'RE GOING INTO LITERATURE AND NEWSPAPER WORK THAT YOU CAN'T AFFORD A CONSCIENCE LIKE THAT
1293,LET STILL I DID AFFORD IT AND HE WROTE THINKING HIS FRIENDS AND DECLINING BECAUSE HE SAID LITTLE SCHEM WOULD FAIL AND OUGHT TO FEEL

1325,THERE CERTAINLY WAS NO INTO IT AND EVEN RUTH WAS PHILADELPHIA IN ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT A STREET OUGHT NOT TO HAVE ANY END OR ARBITCEPTIBLE LIGHT UPON WHICH THE WEARY EYE COULD REST
1326,BUT NEITHER SAINT GERARD NOR BROAD STREET NEITHER WONDERS OF THE MEANT NOR THE GLORIES OF THE HALL WHERE THE GHOSTS OF OUR FATHER'S SIT ALWAYS SHINING THE DECLARATION IMPRESSED THE VISITORS SO MUCH AS THE SPLENDORS OF THE CHESTNUT STREET WINDOWS AND THE BRIGANDS ON ITS STREET

1406,LAKE OF SERVICE FOURTEEN YEARS THREE MONTHS IN FIVE DAYS
1407,HE SEEMED BORN TO PLEASE WITHOUT BEING CONSCIOUS OF THE POWER HE POSSESSED
1408,IT MUST BE OWNED AND NO ONE WAS MORE READY TO CONFESS IT THAN HIMSELF THAT HIS LITERARY ATTAINMENTS WERE BY NO MEANS OF A HIGH ORDER
1409,WE DON'T SPEND TOPS IS A FAVORITE SAYING AMONGST ARTILLERY OFFICERS INDICATING THAT THEY DO NOT SHIRK THEIR DUTY BY FRIVOLOUS PURSUITS BUT IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT SERVANT THAT BEING NATURALLY IDLE WAS VERY MUCH GIVEN TO SPINNING TOPS
1410,ONCE IN ACTION HE WAS LEAVING A DETACHMENT OF INFANTRY THROUGH AN ENTRENCHMENT
1411,SOMETIMES HE WOULD WANDER ON FOOT UPON THE SANDY SHORE SOMETIMES HE WOULD ENJOY RIDE AMONG THE SUMMIT OF THE CLIFF ALTOGETHER BEING AND NO HURRY AT ALL TO BRING HIS TASK TO AN END
1412,NO CATHEDRAL HAD EVEN BURGLARS ITSELF COULD LIE WITH A CHURCH AT NOT MARTIAN
1413,BENZ OF'S MOST AMBITIOUS DESIRE WAS TO INDUCE THE CAPTAIN TO GO WITH HIM AND IN HIS DAYS IN HIS MUCH LOVED HOME AND SO INCESSANTLY WERE SURVEID EXCHERES BESEGED WITH THE SCRIPTIONS OF THE UNPARALLELED BEAUTIES AND ADVANTAGEOUS OF THIS EIGHTEENTH
1414,WHEN A PRIVATE IN THE EIGHT CAVALRY HE HAD BEEN ON THE POINT OF QUITTING THE ARMY AT TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OF AGE BUT UNEXPECTEDLY HE HAD BEEN A POINT AT ORDERLY TO CAPTAIN'S SERVICE
1415,THE BOND OF UNION THUS EFFECTED COULD NEVER BE SEVERED AND ALTHOUGH BINSUS ACHIEVEMENTS HAD FAIRLY EARNED HIM THE RIGHT OF RETIREMENT HE FIRMLY DECLINED ALL HONORS OR ANY PENSION THAT MIGHT PART HIM FROM HIS SUPERIOR OFFICER
1416,UNLESS MASTER HE MADE NO PRETENSION TO ANY GIFT OF POETIC POWER BUT HIS INEXHAUSTIBLE MEMORY MADE HIM ALL LIVING IN PSYCHOPOTIA AND FOR HIS STOCK OF ANECDOTES AND TRUPER'S TALES HE WAS MATCHLESS
1417,THUS AS HIS LEGS COULD CARRY HIM SERVE A DECK HAD MADE HIS WAY TO THE TOP OF THE CLIFF
1418,IT WAS QUITE TRUE THAT A VESSEL WAS IN SIGHT HARDLY MORE THAN SIX MILES FROM THE SHORE BUT OWING TO THE INCREASE IN THE EARTH'S CONDUCTITY AND THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE RANGE OF VISION THE RANGE OF THE TOP MASTS ALONE WAS VISIBLE ABOVE THE WATER
1419,EXCLAIMED SURVER DAK KEEPING HIS EYE I MOVED AT HIS TELEGRAM
1420,SHE IS UNDER SALE BUT SHE IS COUNT HIM SHOTS NOT HE WAS RIGHT
1421,IF THE COUNT WERE ON BOARD A STRANGE VITALITY WAS BRINGING HIM TO THE PRESENCE OF HIS RIVAL
1422,HE RECKONED THEREFORE NOT ONLY UPON ASCERTAINING THE EXTENT OF THE LATE CATASTROPHE BUT UPON LEARNING ITS CAUSE
1423,THE WIND BEING ADVERSE THE DEBRINA DID NOT MAKE VERY RAPID PROGRESS BUT AS THE WEATHER IN SPITE OF A FEW CLOUDS REMAINED CALM AND THE SEA WAS QUITE SMOOTH SHE WAS ENABLED TO HOLD A STEADY COURSE
1424,SEVERA DECK TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT THE DEBRINA WAS ENDEAVORING TO PUT IN
1425,A NARROW CHANNEL FORMED A PASSAGE THROUGH THE RIDGE OF ROCKS THAT PROTECTED IT FROM THE OPEN SEA AND WHICH EVEN IN THE OFFICE WEATHER WOULD INSURE THE CALMNESS OF ITS WATERS
1426,SMIGHTLY CHANGING HER COURSE SHE FIRST STRUCK HER MAINSAIL AND IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE MOVEMENTS OF HER HUMSMAN SOON CARRIED NOTHING BUT HER TWO TOPS NAILS BRIGANTINE AND JIB
1427,CAPTAIN SURVE DIED HASTENED TOWARD HIM
1428,I LEFT YOU ON A CONTINENT AND HERE I HAVE THE HONOR OF FINDING YOU ON AN ISLAND
1429,NEVER MIND NOW INTERPOSED THE CAPTAIN WHEN WE WILL TALK OF THAT BY AND BY
1430,NOTHING MORE THAN YOU KNOW YOURSELF
1431,ARE YOU CERTAIN THAT THIS IS THE MEDITERRANEAN
1432,FOR SOME MOMENTS HE SEEMED PERFECTLY STUPEFIED AND THEN RECOVERING HIMSELF HE BEGAN TO OVERWHELMED THE COUNT WITH A TORRENT OF QUESTIONS
1433,TO ALL THESE INQUIRIES THE COUNT RESPONDED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE
1434,SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE SEEMED TO HIM BROUGHT ABOUT A CONVULSION OF THE ELEMENTS
1435,YOU WILL TAKE ME ON BOARD COUNT WILL YOU NOT
1436,MY AUNT HAS AT YOUR SERVICE SIR EVEN SHOULD YOU REQUIRED TO MAKE A TOUR ROUND THE WORLD
1437,THE COUNT SHOOK HIS HEAD
1438,BEFORE STARTING IT WAS INDISPENSABLE THAT THE ENGINE OF THE DEBRINA SHOULD BE REPAIRED TO SAIL UNDER CANVAS ONLY WOULD IN CONTRARY WINDS AND ROUGH SEAS BE BOTH TEDIOUS AND DIFFICULT
1439,IT WAS ON THE LAST DAY OF JANUARY THAT THE REPAIRS OF THE SCHOONER WERE COMPLETED
1440,A SLIGHT DEMUNITION IN THE EXCESSIVELY HIGH TEMPERATURE WHICH HAD PREVAILED FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS WAS THE ONLY APPARENT CHANGE IN THE GENERAL ORDER OF THINGS BUT WHETHER THIS WAS TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO ANY ALTERATION IN THE EARTH'S ORBIT WAS A QUESTION WHICH WOULD STILL REQUIRE SEVERAL DAYS TO DECIDE
1441,DEATHS NOW AROSE AND SOME DISCUSSION FOLLOWED WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS DESIRABLE FOR BINSOOF TO ACCOMPANY HIS MASTER
1442,HER SEA GOING QUALITIES WERE EXCELLENT AND WOULD HAVE AMPLY SUFFICED FOR A CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE GLOBE
1443,AFTER AN APPRENTICESHIP ON A MERCHANT SHIP HE HAD ENTERED THE IMPERIAL NAVY AND HAD ALREADY REACHED THE RANK OF LIEUTENANT WHEN THE COUNT APPOINTED HIM TO THE CHARGE OF HIS OWN PRIVATE YACH IN WHICH HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SPEND BY FAR THE GREATER PART OF HIS TIME THROUGHOUT THE WINTER GENERALLY CRUISING IN THE MEDITERRANEAN IN THE MEDITERRANEAN IN THE MEDITERRANEAN IN THE MEDITERRANEAN IN THE MEDITERRANEAN IN THE MEDITERRANEAN IN THE MEDITERRANEAN IN THE MEDITERRANEAN IN THE MEDITERRANEANEUFARIAN IN THE MEDITERRANEAN IN THE MEDITERRANEAN IN THE MEDITER
1444,THE LIGHT ASTOUNDING EVENTS HOWEVER HAD RENDERED PROVOKED MANIFESTLY UNEASY AND NOT THE LESS SO FROM HIS CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THE COUNT SECRETLY PARTOOK OF HIS OWN ANXIETY
1445,STEP UP AND CANVAS SPREAD THE SPEAKER STARTED EASTWARDS
1446,ALTHOUGH ONLY A MODERATE BREEZE WAS BLOWING THE SEA WAS ROUGH A CIRCUMSTANCE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR ONLY BY THE DIMINATION IN THE FORCE OF THE EARTH'S ATTRACTION RENDERING THE LIQUID PARTICLE SO BORE IT THAT BY THE MERE EFFECT OF CONSOLATION THEY WERE CARRIED TO A HEIGHT THERE WAS QUITE UNPRECEDENTED
1447,FOR A FEW MILES SHE FOLLOWED THE LINE HITHERTO PRESUMABLY OCCUPIED BY THE COAST OF ALL JULIA BUT NO LAND APPEARED TO THE SOUTH
1448,THE LAW AND THE COMPASS THEREFORE WERE ABLE TO BE CALLED UPON TO DO THE WORK OF THE SEXANT WHICH HAD BECOME UTTERLY USELESS
1449,THERE'S NO FEAR OF THAT SIR
1450,IT THE EARTH HAS UNDOUBTEDLY ENTERED UPON A NEW ORBIT BUT SHE IS NOT ENCOURING ANY PROBABLE RISK OF BEING PRECIPITATED ONTO THE SUN
1451,AND WHAT DEMONSTRATION DO YOU OFFER ASKED SERVICE THAT IT WILL NOT HAPPEN
1452,OSIAN REIGNED SUPREME
1453,ALL THE IMAGES OF HIS PAST LIFE FLOATED UPON HIS MEMORY HIS THOUGHTS SPED AWAY TO HIS NATIVE FRANCE ONLY TO RETURN AGAIN TO WONDER WHETHER THE DEPTHS OF OCEAN WOULD REVEAL ANY TRACES OF THE ADJURION METROPOLIS
1454,IS IT NOT IMPOSSIBLE HE MURMURED ALOUD THAT ANY CITY SHOULD DISAPPEAR SO COMPLETELY
1455,WOULD NOT THE LAWTIEST EMINENCE OF THE CITY AT LEAST BE VISIBLE
1456,ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE WAS MOST REMARKABLE
1457,TO THE SURPRISE OF ALL AN ESPECIALLY OF LIEUTENANT PRECOE THE LINE INDICATED A BOTTOM AT A NEARLY UNIFORM GAP OF FROM FORTIFY FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH THE SOUNDING WAS PERSEVERED WITH CONTINUALLY FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS OVER A CONSIDERABLE AREA
1458,YOU MUST SEE LIEUTENANT I SHOULD THINK THAT WE ARE NOT SO NEAR THE COAST OF ALJURIA AS YOU IMAGINED
1459,AFTER PONDERING A WHILE HE SAID IF WE WERE FARTHER AWAY I SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND A DEPTH OF TWO OR THREE HUNDRED FATHOMS INSTEAD OF FIVE FATHOMS
1460,ITS DEATH REMAINED INVARIABLY STILL FOUR OR AT MOST FIVE FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH ITS BOTTOM WAS ASSIDUOUSLY DREDGED IT WAS ONLY TO PROVE IT BARON OF MARINE PRODUCTION OF ANY TYPE
1461,NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE BUT TO PUT ABOUT AND RETURNED IN DISAPPOINTMENT TOWARD THE NORTH
1462,AT ANOTHER TIME HARROWED ASKED
1463,WHAT IS YOUR COUNTRYAL LOVE HAVE YOU ALWAYS BEEN THROUGH ALL THE THROW'S EYES FLASHED
1464,TWO HUNDRED WARRIORS FEASTED IN HIS HALL AND ALL OF HIM BATTLE

1479,WE ATE IT MANY MEN'S TABLES UNINIDED
1480,I DRAGON'S BELLY IS NEVER FULL AND ON BOARD WENT THE GOLD
1481,OH IT IS BETTER TO LIVE ALMOST SAY THAT OTHER MEN RAISED YOUR CROPS AND COOK YOUR MEALS

1492,THE TURTLES WERE RINGING IN A GREAT POT OF ME
1493,THEY SET UP A CRANE OVER THE FIRE AND HUNG THE POT UPON IT AND WE SAT AND WATCHED IT OIL WHILE WE JUMPED AT LAST THE SUPPER AGAIN
1494,THE FARMER SAT LONELY ON THE BENCH YOU WERE NOT EAT AND YOU CANNOT WONDER FOR HE SAW AS PUTTING HOTELS AT HIS GOOD BEACON BASQUE AND BASHULOSE OF BREAD INTO OUR BIG MOUTHS
1495,YOU WOULD NOT BE WITH US YOU CANNOT SAY NO TO HAVE OF MY ALE I DRINK THIS TO YOUR HEALTH

1531,IT WAS ONE OF THE MASTERLY AND CHARMING STORIES OF DEMOBE THE ELDER
1532,IN FIVE MINUTES I WAS IN A NEW WORLD AND MY MELANCHOLY ROOM WAS FULL OF A IDOLIUS FRENCH COMPANY
1533,THE SOUND OF AN IMPERATIVE AN UNCOMISING DULL RECALLED ME IN DUE TIME TO THE REGIONS OF REALITY
1534,AMMAROUS MET ME AT THE BAR TO THE STAIRS AND SHOWED ME THE WAY TO THE SUPPER ROOM
1535,SHE SIGN TO ME WITH A GHOSTLY SLIMENCY TO TAKE THE VACANT PLACE ON THE LEFT OF HER FATHER
1536,THE DOOR OPENED AGAIN WHILE I WAS STILL STUDYING THE TWO BROTHERS WITHOUT I HONESTLY CONFESS GAINED VERY FAVORABLY IMPRESSED BY EITHER UP THEM
1537,A NEW MEMBER OF THE FAMILY CIRCLE WHO INSTANTLY ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION ENTERED THE ROOM
1538,A LITTLE CRACKED THAT IN THE POPULAR PHRASE IS MY IMPRESSION OF THE STRANGER HE NOW MADE HIS APPEARANCE IN THE SUPPER ROOM
1539,MISTER WHITT ACROSS THE ELDER HAVING NOT SPOKEN ONE WORD THUS FAR HIMSELF INTRODUCED THE NEW COMER TO ME WITH A SIGH GLANCE AND HIS SONS WHICH HAD SOMETHING LIKE TO FINDS AND A GLANCE WHICH AS I WAS SORRY TO NOTICE WAS RETURNED WITH THE DEFINES ON THEIR SIDE BUT THE TWO YOUNG MAN

1548,ILL'S CHEERFUL CONVERSATION WAS THE CONVERSATION WAS THE CONVERSATION ACROSS THE TABLE BETWEEN A ARMY AND ME
1549,YOU LOOKED UP AND NOW ME GOT AND LAY FROM HIS PLAY AND LOOKED DOWN AGAIN SLOWLY WITH A FROWN
1550,WHEN I ADDRESSED AND HE ANSWERED TO STRANGELY
1551,A MORE DREARY AND MORE DISUNITED FAMILY PARTY I NEVER SAT OF TABLE WITH
1552,IN THE HATRED MALICE AND UNTOWABLENESS ARE NEVER SO ESSENTIALLY DETESTABLE TO MY MIND AS WHEN THEY ARE ANIMATED BY THE SENSE OF PROPRIETY AND WORK UNDER THE SURFACE BUT FOR MY INTEREST IN THY OWN MIND AND MY OTHER INTEREST IN THE LITTLE LOVE LOOKS WHICH I SHOULD NEVER HAVE SAT THROUGH THAT SUPPER
1553,I WISH YOU GOOD NIGHT SHE LAID HER BONY HANDS ON THE BACK OF MISTER MEDICAL'S INVALID CHAIR CUT HIM SHORTENED HIS FAREWELL SALUTATION TO ME AND WE'LL HIM OUT TO HIS BED AS IF SHE WERE WHEELING HIM OUT TO HIS GRAY

1556,SILESS FLUNG AWAY WITHOUT A WORD OF PROTEST AMBIROSTO'S GROUND EVIDENTLY DINT ON MAKING HIS PEACE WHEN THEY ON ME BEFORE HE LEFT HER SEEING THAT I WAS IN THE WAY I WALKED ASIDE TOWARD A GLASS DOOR THE LOWER END OF THE ROOM
1557,IT IS MANIFEST THAT MAN IS NOW SUBJECT TO MUCH VERY ABILITY
1558,SO IT IS WITH THE LOWER ANIMALS
1559,THE VERY BILLITY OF MULTIPLE PARTS
1560,BUT THIS SUBJECT WILL BE MORE PROPERLY CAUSE WILL RETREAT OF THE DIFFERENT RACES OF MANKIND
1561,IFACTS OF THE INCREASED USE AND THIS USE OF PARTS
1562,CHAPTER SEVEN ON THE RACES OF MAN
1563,AND DETERMINING WHETHER TWO MORE ALLIED FORMS OUGHT TO BE RANK THE SPECIES OR VARIETIES NATURALISTS ARE PRACTICALLY GUIDED BY THE FOLLOWING CONSIDERATIONS NAMELY THE AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM AND WHETHER SUCH DIFFERENCE RELATE TO FEW OR MANY POINTS DESTRUCTION AND WHETHER THEY ARE CONVENT
1564,ELLOWED O'CLOCK HAD STRUCK IT WAS A FINE CLEAR NIGHT THERE WERE THE ONLY PERSONS ON THE ROAD AND THEY SAUNTERED LEISURELY ALONG TO VOID PAYING A PRICE OF FATIGUE FOR THE RECREATION PROVIDED FOR THE TOLEADONS IN THE VALLEY OR ON THE BANKS OF THEIR RIVER
1565,SICUR AS HE THOUGHT AND THE CAREFUL HAD BEEN A FRATION OF JUSTICE IN THAT CITY AND THE CHARACTER OF ITS WELL DISPOSED THE EVIDENCE THE GOOD ANALOGUE WAS FAR FROM THINKING THAT ANY DISASTER COULD BEFALL HIS FAMILY
1566,RUDALLFUL AND HIS COMPANIONS WITH THEIR FACES MUFFLED IN THEIR CLOAKS STARED RUDELY AND INSOLENTLY AT THE MOTHER THE DAUGHTER AND THE SERVANT ME
1567,IN A MOMENT HE COMMUNICATED HIS THOUGHTS TO HIS COMPANIONS AND IN THE NEXT MOMENT THEY RESOLVED TO TURN BACK IN CARRION OFF TO PLEASE RIDDLE FOR THE RICH WHO ARE OPEN HANDED ALWAYS FINE PARASIES READY TO ENCOURAGE THEIR BAD PROPENSITIES AND THUS TO COULD SEE THIS WICKED DESIGN INTO EFFECT WAS THE COMMUNITY
1568,THEY DREW THEIR SWORDS HID THEIR FACES AND THE FLAPS OF THEIR CLOAKS TURNED BACK AND SOON CAME IN FRONT OF THE LITTLE PARTY WHO HAD NOT YET DONE GETTING THANKS TO GOD FOR THEIR ESCAPE FROM THOSE AUDACIOUS MEN
1569,FINALLY THE ONE PARTY WENT OFF EXULTING AND THE OTHER WAS LEFT IN DESOLATION AND WOE
1570,WRITTEN AND ARRIVED AT HIS OWN HOUSE WITHOUT ANY IMPEDIMENT ALL THE OCCASIONS REACHED THERE'S HEART BROKEN AND TO SPARE
1571,MEANWHILE ROSTOVO HAD LUCIDIOUS SAFE IN HIS CUSTODY AND IN HIS OWN APARTMENT
1572,GOTIUS ME AM I AM DEAD
1573,MOTHER DEAR FATHER DO YOU HEAR ME
1574,IT IS THE ONLY AMENDS I ASK OF YOU FOR THE WRONG YOU HAVE DONE ME
1575,SHE FOUND THE DOOR BUT IT WAS LOCKED OUTSIDE
1576,SHE SUCCEEDED IN OPENING THE WINDOW AND THE MOONLIGHT SHONE IN SO BRIGHTLY THAT SHE COULD DISTINGUISH THE COLOR OF SOME DAMASK HANGING IN THE ROOM
1577,SHE SAW AT THE BED WAS GILDED AND SO RICH THAT IT SEEMED THAT OF A PRINCE ABOUT THAT OF A PRIVATE GENTLEMAN
1578,UPON OTHER THINGS ON WHICH SHE CAST HER EYES WAS A SMALL CRUCIFIX OF SOLID SILVER STANDING ON A CABINET NEAR THE WINDOW
1579,THIS PERSON WAS REPULSED WITHOUT HE HAD GONE TO LOOK FOR HIS FRIENDS HAD CHANGED HIS MIND IN THAT RESPECT NOT THINKING IT ADVISABLE TO ACQUAINT AND BUT WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN HIM AND THE GIRL
1580,ON A CONTRARY HE RESOLVED TO TELL THEM THAT REPENTING OF HIS VIOLENCE AND MOVED BY A TEARS SHE HAD ONLY CARRIED HER HALF WAY TOWARDS HIS HOUSE AND THEN LET HER GO
1581,CHOKING WITH EMOTION OF LEOPAGIA MADE A SIGN TO HER PARENTS THAT SHE WISHED TO BE ALONE WITH THEM
1582,THAT WILL BE VERY WELL MY CHILD REPLIED A FATHER IF YOUR PLAN WERE NOT LIABLE TO BE FRUSTRATED BY ORDINARY CUNNING I'D NO DOUBT THIS IMAGE HAD BEEN ALREADY MISSED BY ITS OWNER AND HE WILL HAVE SET IT DOWN FOR CERTAIN THAT IT WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE ROOM BY THE PERSON HE LOPPED UP THERE
1583,WHAT YOU HAD BEST DO MY CHILD IS TO KEEP IT AND PRAY TO IT THAT SINCE IT WAS A WITNESS TO YOUR END DOING IT WILL GAIN TO INDICATE YOUR COST BY ITS RIGHTEOUS JUDGMENT
1584,THUS DID THEY REMAIN AND RIGHT MINDED FATHER COMFORT HIS UNHAPPY DAUGHTER AND HER MOTHER EMBRACING HER AGAIN IT ALL SHE COULD TO SU THE FEELINGS
1585,SHE MEANWHILE PASSED HER LIFE WITH HER PARENTS AND THE STRICTEST TO RETIREMENT NEVER LETTING HERSELF BE SEEN BUT SHINING EVERY EYE LIFTED SHOULD READ HER MISFORTUNE IN HER FACE
1586,TIME ROLLED ON THE HOUR OF HER DELIRY ARRIVED IT TOOK PLACE IN THE UTMOST SECRECY HER MOTHER TAKEN UPON HER THE OFFICE OF MIDWIFE I SHE GAVE BIRTH TO A SON ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL EVERCY
1587,ON THE BOY WALKED THROUGH THE STREETS BLESSINGS WAS SHOWERED UPON HIM BY ALL WHO SAW HIM BLESSING UP ON HIS BEAUTY UPON THE MOTHER THAT BORE HIM UPON THE FATHER THAT COULD GO HIM UPON THOSE WHO BROUGHT HIM HOT SO WELL
1588,ONE DAY WHEN THE BOY WAS SENT BY HIS GRANDFATHER WITH A MESSAGE TO A RELATION HE PASSED ALONG HIS STREET IN WHICH THERE WAS A GREAT CALM COARS OF HORSEMEN
1589,THE BED SHE TOO WELL REMEMBERED WAS THERE AND ABOVE ALL THE CABINET ON WHICH HAD STOOD THE IMAGE SHE HAD TAKEN AWAY WAS STILL IN THE SAME SPOT
1590,LUIS WAS OUT OF DANGER IN A FORTNIGHT AND A MONTH HE AROSE FROM HIS BED AND JOINED ALL THAT TIME HE WAS VISITED DAILY BY HIS MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER AND TREATED BY THE MASTER AND MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE AS IF HE WAS THEIR OWN CHILD
1591,THUS SAYING AND PRESSING THE CRUCIVE FIXED TO HER BREAST SHE FELL FAINTING INTO THE AMS OF DONNIA WHO HAS A GENTLE WOMAN TO WHOSE SIX PITEOUS A NATURAL AS CRUELTY AS TWO MAN INSTANTLY PRESSED HER LIPS TO THOSE OF THE FAINTING GIRL
1592,I HAVE GREAT THINGS TO TELL YOU IN YOU SAID DORA AS TO A HUSBAND THE CREAM AND SUBSTANCE OF WHICH IS THIS THE FAINING GIRL BEFORE YOU IS YOUR DAUGHTER AND THE BOY IS YOUR GRANDSON
1593,THIS TRUTH WHICH I HAD LEARNED FROM HER LIPS IS CONFIRMED BY HIS FACE AND WHICH WE HAVE BOTH BEHELD THAT OF OUR SON
1594,JUST THERE NEALCADIA CAME TO HERSELF AND EMBRACING ACROSS SEEMED CHANGED INTO THE SEA OF TEARS AND A GENTLEMAN REMAINING IN ORDER THEIR WELCOMEMENT UNTIL HIS WIFE HAD REPEATED TO HIM FROM BEGINNING TO HIM THEIR CURIOUS WHOLE STONE AND HE BELIEVED IT THROUGH THE LESS OF DISPENSATION OF HEAVEN WHICH HAD CONFIRMED IT THROUGH THE BLESSED
1595,SO PERSUASIE WERE HER AND TREATIES AS SO STRONG INFLUENCES THAT NO HARM WHATEVER COULD RESULT TO THEM FROM THE INFLAMMATION SHE SOUGHT THEY WENT INDUCED TO CONFESS THAT ONE SUMMER'S NIGHT THE SAME SHE HAD MENTIONED THEMSELVES IN ANOTHER FRIEND BEING OUT ON THE STROLL WITH HER DOFFAL WITH HER DOFFAL WITH HER DOFFAL WITH HER DOFFAL WITH HER DOFFAL WITH HER DOFFAL WITH HER DOFFAL WITH HER DOFFAL WITH HER DOFFULTERING
1596,FOR GOD'S SAKE MY LADY MIGHT AGAIN ME A WIFE WHO WOULD BE AN AGREEABLE COMPANION NOT ONE WHO WILL DISGUST ME SAID AT ME MAY BOTH BEAR EVENLY AND WITH MUTUAL GOOD WILL THE YOKE AND POST ON US BY HEAVEN INSTEAD OF PULLING THIS WAY AND THAT WAY AND FRETTING IT RATHER TO DEATH
1597,HER BEARING WAS GRACEFUL AND ANIMATED SHE LED HER SON BY THE HAND AND BEFORE HER WALKED TWO MATES WITH WAX LIGHTS AND SILVER CANDLESTICS
1598,AL ROSE TO DO HER REVERENCE AS IF SOMETHING FROM HEAVEN HAD MERACULOUSLY APPEARED BEFORE THEM BUT GAZING ON HER AND TRANCE WITH ADMIRATION NOT ONE OF THEM WAS ABLE TO ADDRESS A SINGLE WORD TO HER
1599,SHE REFLECTED HOW NEAR SHE STOOD TO THE CRISIS WHICH WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER SHE WAS TO BE BLESSED OR UNHAPPY FOR EVER ENACTED BY THE INTENSITY OF HER EMOTIONS SHE SUDDENLY CHANGED COLOR HER HEAD DROPPED AS SHE FELL FORWARD IN A SWOON INTO THE ARMS OF THE DISMAYEDESTAFFANIA
1600,HIS MOTHER HAD LEFT HER TO HIM AS BEING HER DISTANT PROTECTOR BUT WHEN SHE SAW THAT HE TOO WAS INSENSIBLE SHE WAS NEAR MAKING A THIRD AND WOULD HAVE DONE SO HAD HE NOT COME TO HIMSELF
1601,NO THEN SON OF MY HEART THAT THIS FAINTING LADY IS YOUR REAL BRIDE I SAY YOU BECAUSE SHE IS THE ONE WHOM YOU FATHER AND I HAVE CHOSEN FOR YOU AND A PORTRAIT WAS A PRETENCE
1602,JUST AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE TEARS OF THE PITY BEHOLDERS FLOWED FASTEST AND THEIR EJACULATIONS WHERE MOST EXPRESSIVE OF DESPAIR THE OCCASION GAVE SIGNS OF RECOVERY AND BROUGHT BACK GLADNESS TO THE HEARTS OF ALL
1603,WHEN SHE CAME TO HER SENSES AND BLUSHING TO FIND HERSELF AND PUT OFF HIS ARMS WOULD HAVE DISENGAGE HERSELF NO SIGNOR HE SAID THAT MUST NOT BE STRIVE NOT TO WITHDRAW FROM THE HUNS OF HIM WHO HOLDS YOU IN HIS SOUL
1604,THIS WAS DONE FOR THE EVENT TOOK PLACE AT A TIME FOR THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES WAS SUFFICIENT FOR THE CELEBRATION OF THE MARRIAGE WITHOUT ANY OF THE PRELIMINARY FORMALITIES WHICH ARE NOW SO PROPERLY REQUIRED
1605,NO WAS RIDICULOUS SURPRISED THAN THEY AND A BETTER TO ASSURE HIMSELF WHO SO WONDERFUL EFFECT HE BEGGED LOCATE TO GIVE HIM SOME TOKEN WHICH SHOULD MAKE PERFECTLY CLEAR TO HIM THAT WHICH INDEED HE DID NOT DOUBT SINCE IT WAS AUTHENED BY HIS PARENTS
1606,YOU KNOW CAPTAIN LEAK
1607,SAID LORD SILVER ADDRESSING ME
1608,HE HAD HIS HAND ON THE SHOULDER
1609,THEY ARE COUSINS YOU KNOW WE ARE ALL COUSINS
1610,WHATEVER LORD SHELTERED SAID MISS BRANDON RECEIVED IT VERY GRACIOUSLY AND EVEN WITH A MOMENTARY SMILE
1611,BUT HER GREETING TO CAPTAIN LAKE WAS MORE THAN USUALLY HAUGHTY AND FROZEN AND HER FEATURES I FANCIED PARTICULARLY PROUD AND PALE
1612,AT DINNER LAKE WAS EASY AND AMUSING
1613,I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT SAYS WILD OR CHUCKLING INDIGNANTLY ON IT OVER HIS SHOULDER
1614,I BELIEVE I HAVE A LITTLE TASTE THAT WAY THOSE ARE ALL REAL YOU KNOW THOSE JEWELS
1615,AND HE PLACED IT IN THAT GENTLEMAN'S FINGERS WHO NOW TOOK HIS TURNED THE LAMP AND CONTEMPLATED THE LITTLE PARALLELOGRAM WITH A GLEAM OF SLIGHT AMUSEMENT
1616,I WAS THINKING IT'S A VERY LIGHT THE AIS OF HEARTS ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN SOFTLY SMILING ON
1617,WHEREUPON LAKE LAUGHED QUIETLY STILL LOOKING ON THE KNEES OF HEARTS WITH HIS FLY EYES
1618,AND WILDER LAUGHED TOO MORE SUDDENLY AND NOISILY THEN THE SHORE OF THE JOKES SEEMED QUITE TO CALL FOR AND GLANCED A GRIM LOOK FROM THE CORNERS OF HIS EYES UNLAK BUT THE GALLANT CAPTAIN DID NOT SEEM TO PERCEIVE IT AND AFTER A FEW SECONDS MORE HE HANDED IT VERY INNOCENTLY HE HANDED IT VERY INNOCENTLY BACK TO MISSUS DARLING
1619,DO YOU KNOW LAKE OH I REALLY CAN'T TELL BUT HE IS SOON TIRED OF COUNTRY LIFE
1620,HE'S NOT A MAN FOR COUNTRY QUARTERS
1621,I HAVE HORRID DREAM ABOUT HIM LAST NIGHT THERE
1622,OH I KNOW THAT'S LORN BRANDY
1623,ALL THE TIME HE WAS TALKING TO ME THE ANGRY LITTLE EYES WERE FOLLOWING LENGTH
1624,MISS LAKE DECLINED THE CARRIAGE TO NIGHT
1625,AND HE ADDED SOMETHING STILL LESS COMPLIMENTARY
1626,UNTIL THESE VERY WISE THINGS SOMETIMES TURN OUT VERY FOOLISHLY
1627,IN THE MEANTIME I HAD FORMED A NEW IDEA OF HER
1628,BY THIS TIME LORD COVERED AND WILDER RETURNED AND DISGUSTED RATHER WITH MYSELF I RUMINATING ON MY WANT OF GENERAL SHIP
1629,AND HE MADE A LITTLE DIP OF HIS CANE TOWARDS BRAND AND HALL OVER HIS SHOULDER

1641,I AM VERY AN EASY ABOUT IT WHATEVER IT IS I CAN HELPEN
1642,TO MY MIND THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SOMETHING INEXPRESSIBLY AWFUL IN FAMILY FUMES
1643,THE MYSTERY OF THEIR ORIGIN THEIR CAPACITY FOR INVOLVING LATENT FACULTIES OF CRIME AND THE STEADY VITALITY WITH WHICH THEY SURVIVE THE HEARSE AND SPEAK THEIR DEEP NOW FROM THE LIBERTIES IN EVERY NEW BORN GENERATION HAVE ASSOCIATED THEM SOMEHOW IN MY MIND WITH A SPELL OF LIFE EXCEEDING AND DISTINCT FOR HUMAN AND DISTINCT FOR HUMAN AND DISTANT
1644,THE FLOOR MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE SHOWED THE GREAT AGE OF THE ROOM
1645,MY BED WAS UNEXPECTEDLY COMFORTABLE BUT IN MY THEN MOOD I COULD HAVE WISHED IT A GREAT DEAL MORE MODERN
1646,ITS CURTAINS WERE OF THICK AND FEEDED TO THE STREET

1782,THE OLD SERVANT TOLD HIM QUIETLY AS THEY CREPT BACK TO GAME WELL THAT THIS PASSAGE WAY LED FROM THE HUT IN A PRESENCE TO SHOW WOOD AND THAT JEFFORY FOR THE TIME WAS HIDING WITH THE OUT WALLS IN THE FOREST
1783,HE AND POURS US TO BE DISCREET AS THE GRAVE AND THIS MATTER FOR ENSUED HIS LIFE IS IN THE HOLLOW OF OUR HANDS
1784,THEY REGAINED THEIR APARTMENT APPARENTLY WITHOUT DISTURBING THE HOUSEHOLD OF GAME WELL
1785,OUT IN THE WOODS STOOD A NICE LITTLE FURTRY
1786,THE PLACE HE HAD WAS A VERY GOOD ONE THE SUN SHONE ON HIM AS TO FRESH AIR THERE WAS ENOUGH OF THAT AND ROUND HIM DREW MANY LARGE SIZED COMRADES PINES AS WELL AS FURS
1787,HE DID NOT THINK OF THE WARM SUN AND OF THE FRESH AIR HE DID NOT CARE FOR THE LITTLE COTTAGE CHILDREN THAT RAN ABOUT AND RATTLED WHEN THEY WERE IN THE WOOD'S LOOKING FOR WILD STRAWBERRIES
1788,BUT THIS WAS WHAT THE TREE COULD NOT BEAR TO HEAR
1789,IN WINTER WHEN THE SNOW LAY GLITTERING ON THE GROUND A HAIR WOULD OFTEN COME LEAPING ALONG AND JUMPED RIGHT OVER THE LITTLE TREE
1790,OH THAT MADE HIM SO ANGRY
1791,TO GROW AND GROAN TO GET OVER AND BE TALL THOUGHT THE TREE THAT AFTER ALL IS THE MOST OF LIGHT FULL THING IN THE WORLD
1792,IN AUTUMN THE WOODCUTTERS ALWAYS CAME AND FELL SOME OF THE LARGEST TREES
1793,THIS HAPPENED EVERY YEAR AND THE YOUNG FIR TREE THAT HAD NOW GROWN TO A VERY COMELY SIZE TREMBLED AT THE SIGHT FOR THE MAGNIFICENT GREAT TREES FELL TO THE EARTH WITH NOISE AND CRACKING THE BRANCHES WERE LOCKED OFF AND THE TREES LOOKED OFF AND THE TREES WERE LOCKED OFF AND THE TREES WERE LOCKED OFF AND THE BREECHES WERE LOCKED OFF AND THE BRANCHES WERE LOCKED OFF AND THE BRANCHES WERE LOCKED OFF
1794,HAVE YOU NOT YET THE MANEW
1795,RED JOYCE AND LIGHT GROVE SAID THE SUNBEAMS
1796,AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS THEN
1797,I WOULD FAIN KNOW IF I AM DESTINED FOR SO GLORIOUS A CAREER CRIED THE TREE REJOICING
1798,I AM NOW TALL AND MY BRANCHES SPREAD LIKE THE OTHERS THAT WERE CARRIED OFF LAST E'ER OH

1805,BUT THE TREE DID NOT REJOICE AT ALL HE GREW AND GREW AND GREW AND WAS GREEN BOTH WINTER IN SUMMER
1806,AND TOWARDS CHRISTMAS HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THAT WAS CUT DOWN
1807,THE ACTS STRUCK AND DEEP INTO THE VERY FIFTH THE TREE FELL TO THE EARTH WITH A SIGH HE FELT A PANG USE LIKE A SWOON HE COULD NOT THINK OF HAPPINESS FOR HE WAS SORROWFUL AT BEING SEPARATED FROM HIS HOME FROM THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD SPRUNG UP
1808,HE WELL YOU THAT HE SHOULD NEVER SEE HIS DEAR OLD COMRADES THE LITTLE BUSHES AND FLOWERS AROUND HIM ANY MORE PERHAPS NOT EVEN THE BIRDS
1809,THE DEPARTURE WAS NOT AT ALL AGREEABLE
1810,THE TREE ONLY CAME TO HIMSELF WHEN HE WAS UNLOADED IN A COURT YARD WITH THE OTHER TREES AND HEARD A MAN SAY THAT ONE IS SPLENDID WE DON'T WANT THE OTHERS
1811,THERE TWO WERE LARGE EASY CHAIRS SILKEN SOF AS LARGE TABLES FULL OF PICTURES AND FULL OF TOYS WHERE HUNDREDS AND THE HUNDREDS AND THE HUNDREDS OF CROWNS AT LEAST THE CHILDREN HAD SO
1812,THE SERVANTS AS WELL AS THE YOUNG LADIES DECORATED IT
1813,THIS EVENING THEY ALL SAID
1814,HOW IT WILL SHINE THIS EVENING
1815,PERHAPS THE OTHER TREES FROM THE FOREST WILL COME TO LOOK AT ME
1816,IT PLEASED UP FURIOUSLY HELP HELP
1817,CRIED THE YOUNG LADIES AND THEY QUICKLY PUT OUT THE FIRE
1818,EST STORY
1819,A STORY CRIED THE CHILDREN DRAWING A LITTLE FAT MAN TOWARDS THE TREE
1820,BUT I SHALL TELL ONLY ONE STORY
1821,HOW BE DON'T BE FILLED DOWNSTAIRS AND YET HE MARRIED THE PRINCESS
1822,THAT'S THE WAY OF THE WORLD
1823,THOUGHT THE FER TREE AND BELIEVE IT ALL BECAUSE THE MAN WHO TOLD THE STORY WAS SO GOOD LOOKING WELL WELL
1824,I WON'T TROUBLE TO MORROW THOUGHT THE POETRY
1825,AND THE WHOLE NIGHT THE TREE STOOD STILL AND IN DEEP THOUGHT
1826,IN THE MORNING THE SERVANTS AND THE HOUSE MAID CAME IN
1827,BUT THEY DRAGGED HIM OUT OF THE ROOM AND UP THE STAIRS INTO THE LOFT AND HERE IT HAD DARK A CORNER WHERE NO DAY LIGHT COULD ANSWER THEY LEFT HIM
1828,WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS THOUGHT THE TREE
1829,AND HE LEANED AGAINST THE WALL LOST IN REVERIE
1830,TIME ENOUGH HAD HE TOO FOR HIS REFLECTIONS FOR DAYS AND NIGHTS PASSED ON AND NOBODY CAME UP AND WHEN AT LAST SOMEBODY DID COME IT WAS ONLY TO PUT SOME GREAT TRUNKS IN A CORNER OUT OF THE WAY
1831,IT IS NOW WINTER OUT OF DOORS THOUGHT THE TREE
1832,HOW KIND MAN IS AFTER ALL
1833,IF THOUGH THEY WERE NOT SO DARK HERE AND SO TERRIBLY LONELY
1834,SLEEP STRIPPED
1835,THEY SNUFFED ABOUT THE THIRD TREE AND RUSTLED AMONG THE BRANCHES
1836,I AND BY NO MEANS OLD SAID THE THIRD TREE
1837,THERE'S MANY A ONE CONSIDERABLY OLDER THAN I AM
1838,THEY WERE SO EXTREMELY CURIOUS
1839,I KNOW NO SUCH PLACE SAID THE TREE
1840,AND THEN HE TOLD ALL ABOUT HIS YOUTH AND THE LITTLE MICE HAD NEVER HEARD THE LIKE BEFORE AND THEY LISTENED AND SAID
1841,SAID THE THIRD TREE THINKING OVER WHAT HE HAD HIMSELF RELATED
1842,IF IN REALITY THOSE WERE HAPPY TIMES
1843,WHO IT IS UPPY DUPY ASKED THE MICE
1844,OH LEAD THAT ONE AND SAID THE TREE
1845,IT IS A VERY STUPID STORY
1846,DON'T YOU KNOW ONE ABOUT BACON AND PEBGO KINNONS CAN'T YOU KNOW ANY LIGHTER'S STORIES
1847,NO SAID THE TREE
1848,THEN GOOD BY SAID THE ROOTS AND THEY WENT HOME
1849,AT LAST THE LITTLE MICE STAYED AWAY ALSO AND THE TREE SIDE AFTER ALL IT WAS VERY PLEASANT WHEN THE SLEEK LITTLE MICE SAT ROUND ME AND LISTENED TO WHAT I TOLD THEM
1850,NOW THAT TOO HE'S OVER
1851,WHY ONE MORNING THERE CAME A QUANTITY OF PEOPLE AND SET TO WORK IN THE LOFT
1852,THE TRUNKS WERE MOVED THE TREE WAS PULLED OUT AND THROWN RATHER HARD IT IS TRUE DOWN ON THE FLOOR BUT A MAN DREW HIM TOWARDS THE STAIRS WHERE THE DAYLIGHT SHONE
1853,BUT IT WAS NOT THE THIRD TREE THE BIGMENTS
1854,IT WAS IN A CORNER THAT HE LAY AMONG WEEDS AND NETTLES
1855,THE GOLD AND STAR OF TINSULA WAS STILL ON THE TOP OF THE TREE AND GLITTERED IN THE SUNSHINE
1856,IN THE COURT YARD SOME OF THE MARRIED CHILDREN WERE PLAYING WHO HAD DANCED AT CHRISTMAS ROUND THE THIRD TREE AND WERE SO GLAD AT THE SIGHT OF HIM
1857,AND THE GARDENERS BOY CHUPED THE TREE INTO SMALL PIECES THERE WAS A WHOLE HEAP LYING THERE
1858,THE WOOD FLAME UP SPLENDIDLY UNDER THE LARGE BROODING COPPER AND ITS SIDE SO CHEAPLY
1859,HOWEVER THAT WAS OVER NOW THE TREE GONE THE STORY HAD AN END
1860,KENNIC AND BETH REFRAINED FROM TELLING THAT OTHER GIRLS OR UNCLE JOHN OF OLD WILL ROGER'S VISIT BUT THEY GOT MISTER WATSON IN THE LIBRARY AND QUESTIONED HIM CLOSELY ABOUT THE PENALTY FOR FOURTEEN OBJECT
1861,IT WAS A SERIOUS CRIME AND DEEP MISTER WATSON TOLD HIM AND ON GATES BADE FAIR TO SEVERAL LENGTH THE TERM IN THE STATE'S PRISON AS A CONSEQUENCE OF HIS RASH ACT
1862,I CAN'T SEE IT IN THAT LIGHT SAID THE OLD GLARE
1863,IT WAS A DELIVERED ITSELF FROM HIS EMPLOERS TO PROTECT A GIRL HE LOVED
1864,BUT THEY COULD NOT APPROVE IN A CASE AGAINST LUCY IF SHE WAS INNOCENT AND ALL THEIR THREADS OF ARRESTING HER WERE PROBABLY A MERE BLUFF
1865,HE WAS SOFT HEARTED AN IMPETUOUS SAID BETH AND BEING IN LOVE HE DIDN'T STOP TO COUNT THE COST
1866,IF THE PROSECUTION WERE WITHDRAWN AND THE CASE SETTLED WITH THE VICTIM OF THE PORCH CHECK THEN THE YOUNG MAN WOULD BE ALLOWED AS FREEDOM
1867,BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I DOUBT OF SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT COULD BE MADE
1868, FAIR VIEW WAS TWELVE MILES AWAY BUT I TEN O'CLOCK THEY DREW UP AT THE COUNTY TRAIL
1869,THEY WERE RECEIVED IN THE LITTLE OFFICE BY A MAN NAMED MARKEN WHO WAS THE JAILER
1870,WE WISH TO TALK WITH HIM ANSWERED KENNETH TALK

1872,I'LL SAY THAT'S DIFFERENT OBSERVED MARKHAM ALTERING HIS DEMEANOR
1873,MAYBE SEE DATES AT ONCE ASKED KENNETH
1874,THEY FOLLOWED THE JAILER ALONG THE SUCCESSION OF PASSAGES
1875,SOMETIMES AND THAT EARNING FOR A SMOKE OF NEARLY CRAZY NOT A KNOW WHICH IS WORSE DYING ONE WAY OR OTHER
1876,HE AM NOT THE DOOR AND CALLED HERE'S VISITORS TOM
1877,WHORS TWELVE WHORSON ERROR REPLIED THE JAILER GLOOMILY
1878,MISTER GRASP SAID KENNETH NOTICING THE BOY'S FACE CRITICALLY AS HE STOOD WHERE THE LIGHT FROM THE PASSAGE FELL UPON IT
1879,SAR WE HAVEN'T ANY OR SECTION ROOM IN THE JAIL
1880,SIT TOWNS SAID GATE THE NATURE FULL IN PLEASANT VOICE THERE'S A PINCERE
1881,A FRESH WHOLESOME LOOKING BOY WAS TOM GATES WAS STEADY GRAY EYES AN INTELLIGENT FOREHEAD BUT A SENSITIVE RATHER WEAK MOUTH
1882,WE HAVE HEARD SOMETHING OF YOUR STORY SAID KENNETH AND ARE INTERESTED IN IT
1883,I DIDN'T STOP TO THINK WHETHER IT WAS FOOLISH OR NOT I DID IT AND I'M GLAD I DID IT
1884,OLD WILL AS A FINE FELLOW BUT POOR AND HELPLESS SINCE MISSUS ROGERS HAD HER ACCIDENT
1885,THEN ROGERS WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING BUT LEADER AROUND AND WAIT UPON HER AND THE PLACE WENT TO RECKON RUIN
1886,HE SPOKE SIMPLY BUT PACED UP AND DOWN THE NARROW CELL IN FRONT OF THEM
1887,WHOSE NAME DID SHE SIGN TO THE CHECK ASKED KENNETH
1888,HE IS SUPPOSED TO SIGN ALL THE CHECKS OF THE CONSORT
1889,IT THE STOCK COMPANY IN RICH
1890,I WAS BIG KEEPER SO IT WAS EASY TO GET A POINT CHECK AND FORWARD THE SIGNATURE
1891,AS REGARDS MY ROBBING THE COMPANY I'LL SAY THAT I SAVED HIM A HEAVY LOSS ONE DAY
1892,I DISCOVERED AND PUT OUT A FIRE THAT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE WHOLE PLATFORMS SHALL NEVER EVEN THANK ME
1893,IT WAS BETTER FOR HIM TO THINK THE GIRL AND FEELING THAN TO KNOW THE TRUTH
1894,I'M GOING TO SEE MISTER MARSHALL SAID KENNETH AND DISCOVER WHAT I CAN DO TO HIS HISTORY THANK YOU SIR
1895,IT WON'T BE MUCH BUT A GRATEFUL TO FIND A FRIEND
1896,THEY LEFT HIM THEN FOR THE JEWELLER ARRIVED TO UNLOCKED THE DOOR AND DISCORD THEM TO THE OFFICE
1897,I'VE SEEN LOTS OR THAT KINDER MIGHT BE
1898,AND IT HAPPENS A MAN'S DISPOSITION
1899,HE LOOKED UP RATHER AND GRACE ASLEEP AT MOTION THEM TO BE SEATED
1900,SOME GIRLS BEEN IN HERE TWICE TO INTERVIEW MEN AND I HAVE REFUSED TO ADMIT HER
1901,I'M NOT ELECTIONERING JUST NOW
1902,OH WELL SIR WHAT ABOUT EM
1903,AND HE DESERVED SO TERM IN STATE'S PRISON
1904,IT HAS COST ME TWICE SIXTY DOLLARS IN THE NOISE
1905,I'LL PAY ALL THE CAUSE BESIDE

1907,I HAVE WELL REASONS MISTER MARSHALL
1908,GIVE ME A CHECK FOR A HUNDRED FIFTY HAD I'LL TURN OVER TO YOU THE FORTUNE AND WASHED FOR THE PROCEEDINGS
1909,HE DETESTED THE GRASPING DISPOSITION THAT WOULD ENDEAVOR TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS EVIDENT DESIRE TO HELP YOUNG GATES
1910,BETH UNEASY AT HIS SILENCE TOUCHED HIM
1911,THERE WAS A GRIM SMILE OF AMUSEMENT ON HIS SHREWD FACE
1912,HE MIGHT HAVE HAD THAT TORCH CHECK FOR THE FACE OF IT IF HE'D BEEN SHARP
1913,AND TO THINK WE CAN SAVE ALL THAT MISERY AND DESPAIR BY THE PAYMENT OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS
1914,SO TO THE SURPRISE THAT THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE AND ALL HIS FRIENDS MISTER HOPKINS ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD OPPOSE LODGE A GRASS OF CAMPAIGN WITH AN EQUAL AGGRESSIVENESS AND SPENT AS MANY DOLLARS IN DOING SO AS MIGHT BE NECESSARY
1915,ONE OF MISTER HOPKINS FIRST TASK AFTER CALLING HIS FAITHFUL INCH BITTER ROUND HIM WAS TO MAKE A CAREFUL CANVAS OF THE VOTERS OF HIS DISTRICT TO SEE WHAT WAS STILL TO BE ACCOMPLISHED
1916,THE WEEK NEEDS CONTINGENCY MUST BE STRENGTHENED AND FORTIFIED AND A COUPLE OF HUNDRED VOTES IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER SECURED FROM THE OPPOSITION
1917,THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE FIGURED OUT AWAY TO DO THIS
1918,UNDER ORDINARY CONDITIONS RENAL'S WAS SURE TO BE ELECTED BUT THE COMMITTEE PROPOSED TO SACRIFICE HIM IN ORDER TO ELECTRICALS
1919,THE ONLY THING NECESSARY WAS TO THICK SET RIDDLES AND THIS HOPKINS ARRANGED PERSONALLY
1920,AND THIS WAS WHY KENNETH AND BETH DISCOVERED HIM CONVERSING WITH THE YOUNG WOMAN IN THE BUGGY
1921,THE DESCRIPTION SHE GAVE OF THE COMING RECEPTION TO THE WOMEN'S POLITICAL LAKE WAS SO HUMOROUS AND DIVERTING THAT THEY WERE BOTH LAUGHING HEARTILY OVER THE THING WHEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE PASSED THEM AND THUS MISTER HOPKINS FAILED TO NOTICE THROUGH THE OCCUPANT OF THE OTHER VEHICLE WERE
1922,THESE WOMEN WERE FLATTERED BY THE ATTENTION OF THE YOUNG LADY AND HAD PROMISED TO ASSIST IN ALIGHTING MISTER FORBES
1923,LOUISE HOPED FOR EXCELLENT RESULTS FROM THIS ORGANIZATION AND WISHED THE ENTERTAINMENT TO BE SO EFFECTIVE IN WINNING THEIR GOOD WILL THAT THEY WOULD WORK EARNESTLY FOR THE CAUSE IN WHICH THEY WERE ENLISTED
1924,THE FAIR VIEW BAND WAS ENGAGED TO DISCOURSE AS MUCH HARMONY AS IT COULD PRODUCE AND THE RESOURCES OF THE GREAT HOUSE WERE TAX TO ENTERTAIN THE GUESS
1925,TABLES WERE SPREAD ON THE LAWN AND A DAY DEEP AT SUBSTANTIAL REPAST WAS TO BE SERVED
1926,THIS WAS THE FIRST OCCASION WITHIN A GENERATION WHEN SUCH AN ENTERTAINMENT HAD BEEN GIVEN AN ELMHURST AND THE ONLY ONE WITHIN THE MEMORY OF MAN WERE THE NEIGHBORS AND COUNTRY PEOPLE HAD BEEN THE INVITED GUESS
1927,THE ATTENDANTS WAS UNEXPECTEDLY LARGE AND THE GIRLS WERE DELIGHTED FOR SEEING GREAT SUCCESS FOR THEIR FIGHT
1928,WE OUGHT TO HAVE MORE ATTENTION'S DEATH SAID LOUISE APPROACHING HER COUSIN
1929,W'T YOU RUN INTO THE HOUSE AND SEE IF MORE THE CAMPS FAIR ONE OR TWO MORE MATES
1930,SHE WAS VERY FOND OF THE YOUNG LADIES WHOM SHE HAD KNOWN WHEN IT OF JANE WAS THEIR MISTRESS HERE AND BETH WAS HER SPECIAL FAVOURITE
1931,THE HOUSEKEEPER LED THE WAY AND BETH FOLLOWED
1932,FOR A MOMENT THAT STOOD STARING WHILE THE NEW MADE REGARDED HER WITH COMPOSURE AND OF FLIGHT SMILE UPON HER BEAUTIFUL FACE
1933,SHE WAS DRESSED IN THE VACILLATION COST YOU OF THE MATES I OWN HURST A PLAIN BLACK GOWN WITH A WHITE APRON AND CAP
1934,THAN SHE GAVE A LITTLE OUT AND REPLIED NO MISS BETH I MOSE OF IT PERSONS
1935,BUT IT CAN BE PROTESTED THE GIRL
1936,I ATTEND TO THE HOUSEHOLD BED IN YOU KNOW AND CARE FOR THE LINEN
1937,YOU SPEAK LIKE AN EDUCATED PERSON SAID BETH WONDERINGLY WHEREAS YOUR HOME
1938,FOR THE FIRST TIME THE MAID SEEMED A LITTLE CONFUSED AND HER GAZE WANDERED FROM THE FACE OF HER VISITOR
1939,SHE SAT DOWN IN A ROCKING CHAIR AND CLASPING HER HANDS IN HER LAP ROCKS SLOWLY BACK AND FORTH I'M SORRY SAID BETH
1940,HALISED OF PERSONS SHOOK HER HEAD
1941,THEY THEY EXCITE ME AND SOME WAY AND I CAN'T BEAR THEM YOU MUST EXCUSE ME
1942,SHE EVEN SEEMED MILDLY AMUSED AT THE ATTENTION SHE ATTRACTED
1943,BUT WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL THE HANDSOMEST OF THE THREE COUSINS BY FAR YET ALLISES SURPASSED HER IN NATURAL CHARM AND SEEMED WELL AWARE OF THE FACT
1944,HER MANNER WAS NEITHER INDEPENDENT NOR A SORT OF BUT RATHER ONE OF WELL BRED COMPOSURE AND CALM RELIANCE
1945,HER EYES WANDERED TO THE MAID'S HANDS
1946,HOWEVER HER FEATURES AND FAR MIGHT REPRESS ANY EVIDENCE OF NERVOUSNESS THESE HANDS TOLD A DIFFERENT STORY
1947,SHE ROSE QUICKLY TO HER FEET WITH AN IMPETUOUS GESTURE THAT MADE HER VISITOR CATCH HER BREATH
1948,I WISH I KNEW MYSELF SHE CRIED FIERCELY
1949,WOULD YOU LEAVE ME ALONE IN MY OWN ROOM OR MUST I GO AWAY TO ESCAPE YOU
1950,ALWAYS I CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER WITH A DECIDED SWAM AND A KEY QUICK IN THE LOCK
1951,CONCOURT RETURNED TO ITS PLACE AMIDST THE TENTS
1952,THE ENGLISH THOUGHT IT TO THE FRENCH BASKETS OF FLOWERS OF WHICH THEY HAD MADE A PLENTABLE PROVISION TO GREET BE ARRIVAL OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS THE FRENCH IN RETURN INVITED THE ENGLISH TO A SUPPER WHICH WAS TO BE GIVEN THE NEXT DAY
1953,KING GRADULATIONS WERE POURED IN UPON THE PRINCESS EVERYWHERE DURING HER JOURNEY
1954,FROM THE RESPECT PAID HER ON ALL SIDES SHE SEEMED LIKE A CLEAN AND FROM THE ADORATION WITH WHICH SHE WAS TREATED BY TWO OR THREE SHE APPEARED IN OBJECT OF WORSHIP BUT QUEEN MOTHER GAVE THE FRENCH THE MOST AFFECTIONATE RECEPTION FRANCE WAS HER NATIVE COUNTRY AND SHE HAD SUFFERED TOO MUCH IN FRANCE WAS HER NATIVE COUNTRY AND SHE HAD SUFFERED
1955,SHE TAUGHT HER DAUGHTER THEN BY HER OWN AFFECTION FOR IT THAT LOVE HER COUNTRY WHERE THEY HAD BOTH BEEN HOSPITABLY RECEIVED AND WHERE A BRILLIANT FUTURE OPEN FOR THEM
1956,THEY COUNT HAD THROWN HIMSELF BACK ON HIS SEAT LEANING HIS SHOULDERS AGAINST THE PARTITION OF THE TENT AND REMAINED THUS HIS FACE BURIED IN HIS HANDS WITH HEAVING CHEST AND RESTLESS LIMBS
1957,THIS HAS INDEED BEEN A HARASSING DAY CONTINUED THE YOUNG MAN HIS EYES FIXED UPON HIS FRIEND
1958,YOU WILL BE FRANK WITH ME I ALWAYS OWN
1959,CAN YOUR MAJESTY MY BUCKINGHAM HAS BEEN SO VIOLENT AND I SUSPECT
1960,IT IS YOU WERE MISTAKEN ROW I HAVE READ HIS DISTRESS IN HIS EYES IN HIS EVERY GESTURE AND ACTION THE WHOLE DAY
1961,I CAN PERCEIVE LOVE CLEARLY ENOUGH
1962,I AM CONVINCED OF WHAT I SAY SAID THE COUNT
1963,IT ISN'T NO USE THEN
1964,IN THOSE VERY TERMS I EVEN HAD IT MORE
1965,BUT CONTINUED ROW NOT INTERRUPTED BY THE MOVEMENT OF HIS FRIEND HEAVEN BE PRAISED THE FRENCH WHO ARE PRONOUNCED TO BE THOUGHTLESS IN INDISCREET RECKLESS EVEN ARE CAPABLE OF BRINGING A COMMON SOUND JUDGMENT TO BEAR OWN MATTERS OF SUCH HIGH IMPORTANCE
1966,THUS IT IS NOT THE HONOR OF THE RACE SAVED A COUNTRY OUR MASTERS AND ARGON
1967,YES I NEED REPOSE MANY THINGS HAVE AGITATED ME THE DAY BOTH IN LINE AND BODY WHEN YOU RETURNED TO MORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE THE SAME MAN
1968,BUT IN THIS FAMILY PRESSURE ROC COULD DETECT THEM OF HIS AGITATION OF A GREAT INTERNAL CONFLICT
1969,THE NIGHT WAS CLEAR SCARLET AND SPLENDID THE TEMPEST HAD PASSED AWAY AND THE SWEET INFLUENCES OF THE EVENING HAD RESTORED LIFE PEACE AND SECURITY EVERYWHERE
1970,UPON THE LARGE SQUARE IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL THE SHADOWS OF THE TENTS INTERSECTED BY THE GOLDEN MOONBEAMS FORMED AS IT WERE A HUGE MOOSEACHE OF JET AND YELLOW FLAG STONES
1971,BRAYLE ON WASHED FOR SOME TIME THE CONDUCT OF THE TWO LOVERS LISTEN TO THE LOUD AND OF CIVIL SLUMBERS OF MANICEMP WHO SNORED AS IMPERIOUSLY AS THOUGH HE WAS WEARING HIS BLUE AND GOLD INSTEAD OF HIS VIOLET SUIT
1972,THE WIFE MAKES ANOTHER DISCOVERY
1973,THEY WERE CERTAINLY NO NEAR THE SOLUTION OF THEIR PROBLEM
1974,THE POOR LITTLE THINGS CRIED CYNTHIA THINK OF THEM HAVING BEEN TURNED TO THE WALL ALL THESE YEARS
1975,NO WHAT IS THE SENSE OF IT TOO IS IT BEING IS LIKE THAT
1976,BUT JOY'S HAD NOT BEEN LISTENING ALL AT ONCE SHE PUT OUT HER CANDLE ON THE TABLE AND FACED HER COMPANION
1977,THE TWIN BROTHER DID SOMETHING SHE DIDN'T LIKE AND SHE TURNED HIS PICTURE TO THE WALL
1978, HERS HAPPENED TO BE ON THE SAME FRIEND TOO BUT SHE EVIDENTLY GAINED CARE ABOUT IT
1979,NOW WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY SENT THE ASB
1980,I THOUGHT WE WERE STUMP AGAIN WHEN I FIRST SAW THAT PICTURE BUT IT'S MEN OF SOME NEWS AFTER ALL
1981,DO YOU SUPPOSE THE NATURE WAS A COPY OF THE SAME THING
1982,WHAT ON THE WORLD IS IT QUARRY JOYCE
1983,THEY WEREN'T BE TERRIBLY EMPHASIZED I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT THIS LOVELY FURNITURE LOOKS LIKE WITHOUT SUCH QUANTITY OF DUST ALL OVER IT TO IT SCHEME SOON
1984,WILL COME IN HERE THIS AFTERNOON WITH OLD CLOTHES ON AND HALF A REGULAR HOUSE CLEANING
1985,HE CAN'T HEARD ANYTHING I'M SURE FOR WE BOTH DISTURBED THINGS AT ALL
1986,THIS THOUGHT HOWEVER DID NOT ENTER THE HEADS OF THE ENTHUSIASTIC PAIR
1987,SMUGGLING THE HOUSE CLINGING PAIRFAMILIA INTO THE CELLAR WINDOW UNOBSERVED THAT AFTERNOON PROVED NO EASY TASK FOR SYLVIA HAD ADDED A WHISPER AND DUSK HAND TO THE OUTFIT
1988,THE LAWYER PROVED TOO MUCH FOR HIM ANY CAME SPORTING AFTER IT AS BRISKLY AS A YOUNG KITTEN MUCH TO SIMPLY AS DELIGHT WHEN SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM
1989,OH LET HIM COME ALONG SHE URGED DI'D I DO LOVE TO SEE HIM ABOUT THAT OLD HOUSE
1990,HE MAKES IT SORT OF OPPOSIER
1991,NOW ITS DUST BEFORE I'M PICTURES
1992,YET LITTLE AS IT WAS IT HAD ALREADY MADE OF VAST DIFFERENCE IN THE ASPECT OF THE ROOM
1993, SURFACE THUS AT LEAST HAD BEEN REMOVED AND THE FINE OLD FURNITURE GAVE A HINT OF ITS REAL ELEGANCE AND POLISHED
1994,THEN SHE SUDDENLY REMARKED
1995,AND MY POCKET WHEN IT IS GETTING LO AGAIN AND YOU HAVE IT ANY LEFT AS USUAL
1996,THEY SAY ILLUMINATION BY CEMILITE IS THE PRETTIEST IN THE WORLD
1997,WHY IT TO ADMIRE IT AS USUAL DID BOTH CRIED PEERING HIM
1998,IS IN HAY THE GREATEST FOR GETTING INTO AWED CORNERS
1999,FOR GETTING ALL THEIR WEARINESS THEY SEE THE CHANNELS AND STREET THROUGH THE HOUSE BINDING ON OCCASIONAL PAPER TUCKED AWAY IN SO ODD CORNER
2000,WELL I'M CONVINCED THAT THE BOARDED UP HOUSE MYSTERY HAPPENED NOT EARLIER THAN APRIL SIXTEEN EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE AND PROBABLY NOT MUCH LATER
2001,NO WORDS WERE SPOKEN NO LANGUAGE WAS UTTERED SAVE OUT OF WAYLLING IN A HISSING AND THAT SOMEHOW WAS INDISTINCT AS IF IT EXISTED IN FANCY AND NAUGHT AND REALITY
2002,I HEARD A NOISE BEHIND I TURNED AND SAW CALFOUR HIS BLACK EYES SHINING WHILE IN HIS HAND HE HELD A GLEAMING KNIFE HE LIFTED ABOVE HIS HEAD AS IF TOO STRIKE BUT I HAD THE STRENGTH OF TEN MEN AND I HURLED HIM FROM ME
2003,ALM WHERE SAID A DISTANT VOICE
2004,NO SOUND BROKE THIS STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT
2005,THE STORY OF ITS EVIL INFLUENCE CAME BACK TO ME AN IN MY BEWILDERED CONDITION I WONDERED WHETHER THERE WAS NOT SOME TRUTH IN WHY HAD BEEN SAID
2006,WHAT WAS THAT
2007,WHAT THEN I HUMAN HAND LARGE AND SHAPELY APPEARED DISTINCTLY ON THE SURFACE OF THE POND
2008,NOTHING MORE NOT EVEN THE RISKS TO WHICH IT MIGHT BE ATTACHED
2009,IT DID NOT BECKON OR INDEED MOVE IT ALL IT WAS AS STILL AS THE HAND OF DEATH
2010,I AWOKE TO CONSCIOUSNESS FIGHTING AT FIRST AS SEEMED AS IF I WAS FIGHTING WITH THE PHANTOM BUT GRADUALLY MY UPON IT BECAME MORE REAL TO ME IT WAS CAPTURE
2011,A SOUND A VOICES A LASH OF LIGHT
2012,A FEELING OF FREEDOM AND I WAS AWAKE WHERE
2013,SAID ANOTHER VOICE WHICH I RECOGNIZED OUR VOLTURES CATHERINE
2014,I HAD SCARCELY KNOW WHERE I HAD BEEN SAYING UP TO THIS TIME BUT AS HE SPOKE I LOOKED AT MY HAND
2015,IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON I SAW A KNIFE RED WITH BLOOD AND MY HAND TOO WAS ALL SAINT DISCOLARD
2016,I DO NOT KNOW I AM DAZED BEWILDERED
2017,BUT THAT IS CATHERINE'S LIFE
2018,I KNOW HE HOW IT THIS VERY EVENING
2019,I WROTE SAYING HOW WE'D BEEN TOGETHER
2020,WHILE CHAIR PICKED UP SOMETHING FROM THE GROUND AND LOOKED AT IT
2021,I SAY YOU DO KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS AND YOU MUST TELL US
2022,A TERRIBLE THOUGHT FLASHED INTO MY MIND
2023,I HAD AGAIN BEEN ACTING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS MAN'S POWER
2024,PERCHANCE TWO CALFERS DEATH MIGHT SERVE HIM IN GOOD STEAD
2025,MY TONGUE REFUSED PARTICULARLY MY POWER OF SPEECH LAUGHED ME
2026,MY POSITION WAS TOO TERRIBLE
2027,MY OVER WROUGHT NORTH YIELDED AT LAST
2028,FOR SOME TIME AFTER THAT I REMEMBERED NOTHING DISTINCTLY
2029,THE THREE MODES OF MANAGEMENT
2030,TO SUPPOSE THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS WORK IS TO AID IN AFFECTING SUCH A SUPPOSITION IS THAT IS ENTIRELY TO MISTAKE ITS NATURE AND DESIGN
2031,BY REASON AN AFFECTION
2032,AS THE CHASE DRIVES AWAY MARY STANDS BEWILDERED AND PERPLEXED ON THE DOOR STEP HER MIND IN A TUMULT OF EXCITEMENT IN WHICH HATRED OF THE DOCTOR DISTRUST AND SUSPICION OF HER MOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT VEXATION OF HER MOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT VEXATION AND ILL HUMOR DISAPPOINTMENT VEXATION AND ILL HUMOR DISAPPOINTMENT VEXATION AND ILL HUMOR DISAPPOINTMENT VEXATION OF HER MOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT VEXATION AND ILL HUMOR DISAPPOINTMENT VEXATION OF HER MOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT VEXATION AND ILL HUMOR DISAPPOINTMENT VEXATION AND ILL HUMOR DISAPPOINTMENT VEXATION AND ILL HUMOR DISAPPOINTMENT VEXATION AND ILL HUMOR DISAPPOINTMENT VEXATION AND ILL HUMOR DISAPPOINTMENT VEXATION OF HER MOTHER
2033,THE MOTHER AS SOON AS THE CHASE IS SO FAR TURNED THAT MARY CAN NO LONGER WHAT THE EXPRESSION OF HER COUNTENANCE GOES AWAY FROM THE DOOR WITH A SMILE OF COMPLACENCY AND SATISFACTION ON HER FACE AT THE INGENUITY AND SUCCESS OF HER LITTLE ART OF US
2034,SO YOU WILL BE A GOOD GIRL I KNOW AND NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE BUT WE'LL STAY AT HOME CONTENTEDLY WON'T YOU
2035,THE MOTHER IN MANAGING THE CASE IN THIS WAY RISE PARTLY ON CONVINCING THE REASON OF THE CHILD AND PARTLY ON AN APPEAL TO HER AFFECTION
2036,IF YOU SHOULD NOT BE A GOOD GIRL BUT SHOULD SHOW SIGN OF MAKING AS ANY TROUBLE I SHALL HAVE TO SEND YOU OUT SOMEWHERE TO THE BACK PART OF THE HOUSE UNTIL WE ARE GONE
2037,BUT THIS LAST SUPPOSITION IS ALMOST ALWAYS UNNECESSARY FOR IF MARY HAS BEEN HABITUALLY MANAGED ON THIS PRINCIPLE SHE WILL NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE
2038,IT IS INDEED TRUE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF TACT AND SKILL IN THE TRAINING OF THE YOUNG AND OF CULTIVATING THEIR REASON AND SECURING THEIR AFFECTION CANNOT BE ALREADY
2039,TO SUCH PERSONS THESE INTELLECT OF TRAINING CHILDREN IN HABITS OF SUBORDINATION TO THEIR WILL OR RATHER OF YIELDING TO THEIR INFLUENCE ARE SPECIAL
2040,DELA HAD A YOUNG SISTER NAMED RIA AND A COUSIN WHOSE NAME WAS JANE
2041,NOW JELLY CONTRIVED TO OBTAIN A GREAT INFLUENCE AND ASCENDANCY OVER THE MIND OF THE CHILDREN BY MEANS OF THESE DOGS
2042,TO GIVE AN IDEA OF THESE CONVERSATIONS I WILL REPORT ONE OF THEM IN FULL
2043,YOU HAVE COME AND DULLAH AND DELICATE WAS THE NAME OF JANE STILL TO MAKE ROSEILY A VISIT
2044,I'M VERY GLAD
2045,I EXPECT YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD GIRL AND EMMA SINCE YOU WERE HERE LAST
2046,THEN TURNING TO JANE SHE ASKED IN A SOMEWHAT ALTERED TONE HAS SHE BEEN A GOOD GIRL JANE
2047,FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN PLAYING UPON THE PIAZZA WITH BLOCKS AND OTHER PLAYTHINGS AND FINALLY HAD GONE INTO THE HOUSE LEAVING ALL THE THINGS ON THE FLOOR OF THE PIAZZA INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM AWAY IN THEIR PLACES AS THEY OUGHT TO HAVE DONE
2048,THEY WERE NOW PLAYING WITH THEIR DOGS IN THE PARLOR
2049,DELLY CAME TO THE PARLOR AND WITH AN AIR OF GREAT MYSTERY BECKONED THE CHILDREN ASIDE AND SET TO THEM IN A WHISPER LEAVE AND BELL AND ROSELY HERE AND DON'T SAY A WORD TO THEM
2050,SO SAYING SHE LED THE WAY ON TIPTOE FOLLOWED BY THE CHILDREN OUT OF THE ROOM AND ROUND BY A CIRCUITOUS ROOT TO THE PIAZZA THERE
2051,SAID SHE POINTING TO THE PLAYTHINGS SEE
2052,PUT THESE PLAY THINGS ALL AWAY QUICK AND CAREFULLY AND WE WILL NOT LET THEM KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR LEAVING THEM OUT
2053,AND THIS METHOD OF TREATING THE CASE WAS MUCH MORE EFFECTUAL IN MAKING THEM DISPOSED TO AVOID COMMITTING A SIMILAR FALL ANOTHER TIME THAN ANY DIRECT REVIEWS OR EXPRESSIONS OF DISPLEASURE ADDRESSED PERSONALLY TO THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN
2054,NATURE OF THE EFFECT PRODUCED BY EARLY IMPRESSIONS
2055,THAT IS COMPARATIVELY NOTHING
2056,THEY ARE CHIEFLY FORMED FROM COMBINATIONS OF THE IMPRESSIONS MADE IN CHILDHOOD
2057, VAST IMPORTANCE AND INFLUENCE OF THIS MENTAL FURNISHING
2058,WE HOPE GOING TO ANY SUCH EXTREME AS THIS WE CAN EASILY SEE UNRELACTION HOW VAST IN INFLUENCE ON THE IDEAS AND CONCEPTIONS AS WELL AS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF ACTION IMMATURE YEARS MUST BE EXERTED BY THE NATURE AND CHARACTER OF WHICH A PERIODED BY THE NATURE AND CHARACTER OF WHICH THE MIND
2059,THE PAIN PRODUCED BY AN ACT OF HASTY AND ANGRY VIOLENCE TO WHICH A FATHER SUBJECTS HIS SON MAY SOON PASS AWAY BUT THE MEMORY OF IT DOES NOT PASS AWAY WITH THE PAIN
2060,BUT ANDREW'S CARED NOTHING ABOUT THAT
2061,HE MADE ABOVE SO DEEP THAT HIS BACK CAME NEAR BREAKING AND HE WAS DONE FOUND I CAN TELL YOU WHEN HE SAW IT WAS NOBODY BUT ANSWERS
2062,HE WAS SUCH A BIG BOY THAT HE WORE HIGH BOOTS AND CARRIED A JACK KNIFE
2063,NOW THIS NIGHT WAS SPLENDID THOUGH HALF THE BLADE WAS GONE AND THE HANDLE WAS A LITTLE CRACKED AND ENTERS KNEW THAT ONE IS ALMOST A MAN AS SOON AS ONE HAS A JACKKNIFE
2064,YES WHYIN UP THOUGHT ANDERS
2065,SEEING THAT I AM SO FINE I MAY AS WELL GO AND VISIT THE KING
2066,I AM GOING TO THE COURT BALL ANSWERED ADDERS
2067,AND SHE TOOK ENTERS HAND AND WALKED WITH HIM UP THE BROAD MARBLE STAIRS WHERE SOLDIERS WERE POSTED AT EVERY THIRD STEP AND THROUGH THE MAGNIFICENT HALLS WHERE COURTIERS IN SILK AND VELVET STOOD BOWING WHEREVER HE WENT
2068,FOR LIKE AS NOT THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT HIM A PRINCE WHEN THEY SAW HIS FINE CAP
2069,AT THE FARTHER END OF THE LARGEST HALL A TABLE WAS SET WITH GOLDEN CUPS AND GOLDEN PLATES IN LONG ROWS
2070,ON HUGE SILVER PLANTERS WERE PYRAMIDS OF TIGHT AND CAKES AND RED WINE SPARKLED IN GLITTERING THE CANDLES
2071,THE PRINCESS SAT DOWN UNDER A BLUE CANOPY WITH BOUQUETS OF ROSES AND SHE LET AND HER SIT IN A GOLDEN CHAIR BY HER SIDE
2072,BUT YOU MUST NOT EAT WITH YOUR CAP ON YOUR HEAD SHE SAID AND WAS GOING TO DAY IT OFF
2073,THE PRINCESS CERTAINLY WAS BEAUTIFUL AND HE WOULD HAVE DEARLY LIKE TO BE KISSED BY HER BUT THE CAP WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD MADE HE WOULD NOT GIVE UP ON ANY CONDITION
2074,HE ONLY SHOOK HIS HEAD
2075,WELL BUT NOW SAID THE PRINCESS AND SHE FILLED HIS POCKETS WITH CAKES AND PUT HER OWN HEAVY GOLD CHAIN AROUND HIS NECK AND BENT DOWN AND KISSED HIM
2076,THAT IS A VERY FINE HELP YOU HAVE HE SAID
2077,SO IT IS SAID ANDREWS
2078,AND IT IS MADE OF MOTHER'S BEST YARN AND SHE KNITTED HERSELF AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET IT AWAY FROM ME
2079,WITH ONE GUMP ANDERS GOT OUT OF HIS CHAIR
2080,HE DARTED LIKE AN ARROW THROUGH ALL THE HALLS DOWN ALL THE STAIRS AND ACROSS THE YARD
2081,HE STILL HELD ONTO IT WITH BOTH HANDS AS HE RUSHED INTO HIS MOTHER'S COTTAGE
2082,AND ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS STOOD ROUND AND LISTENED WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN
2083,BUT WHEN HIS BIG BROTHER HEARD THAT HE HAD REFUSED TO GIVE HIS CAP FOR A KING'S GOLDEN CROWN HE SAID THAT ANSWERS WAS A STUPID
2084,AND HER'S FACE GREW RED
2085,BUT HIS MOTHER HOPPED IN CLOSE
2086,NO MY LITTLE FUN SHE SAID
2087,IF YOU DRESSED UNTIL AND GOLD FROM TOP TO TELL YOU COULD NOT LOOK ANY NICER THAN IN YOUR LITTLE RED CAP
2088,AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE BANQUET WHICH WAS SERVED AT FIVE O'CLOCK THE KING ENTERED HIS CABINET WERE HIS SAILORS OR AWAITING HIM FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRYING ON THE CELEBRATED COSTUME REPRESENTING SPRING WHICH WAS THE RESULT OF SO MUCH IMAGINATION AND HAD COST SO MANY EFFORTS OF THE COURT
2089,HA VERY WELL
2090,LET HIM COME IN THEN SAID THE KING AND AS IF KALDBAIR HAD BEEN LISTENING AT THE DOOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF KEEPING HIMSELF ALL KORONT WITH THE CONVERSATION HE ENTERED AS SOON AS THE KING HAD PRONOUNCED HIS NAME TO THE TWO COURTIERS
2091,JUTVENEER POSTS WERE UPON SAYING AND YON AND VIEWER I TOOK THEIR LEAVE
2092,CERTAINLY SIRE BUT I MUST HAVE MONEY TO DO THAT WHAT
2093,WHAT DO YOU MEAN INQUIRED VOICE
2094,HE HAS GIVEN THEM WITH TOO MUCH GRACE NOT TO HAVE OTHERS STILL TO GIVE IF THEY ARE REQUIRED WHICH HAS THE CASE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT
2095,IT IS NECESSARY THEREFORE THAT HE SHOULD COMPLY THE KING FROWNED
2096,DOES YOUR MAJESTY THEN NO LONGER BELIEVE THE DESTROYER ATTEMPT
2097,NOT AT ALL YOU ARE ON THE CONTRARY MOST AGREEABLE TO ME
2098,YOUR MAJESTY IS PLANNED THEN AND THIS AFFAIR IS
2099,YOU WILL TAKE THEM FROM MY PRIVATE TREASURE
2100,THE NEWS CIRCULATED WITH THE RAPIDITY OF LIGHTNING DURING ITS PROGRESS IT KINDLED EVERY VARIETY OF COCATRY DESIRE AND WILD AMBITION
2101,THE KING HAD COMPLETED HIS TOILET BY NINE O'CLOCK HE APPEARED IN AN OPEN CARRIAGE DECORATED WITH BRANCHES OF TREES AND FLOWERS
2102,THE QUEEN HAD TAKEN THEIR SEATS UPON A MAGNIFICENT DAYS OR PLATFORM ERECTED UPON THE BORDERS OF THE LAKE IN A THE THEATER OF WONDERFUL ELEGANCE OF CONSTRUCTION
2103,SUDDENLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESTOREING PEACE IN ORDER SPRING ACCOMPANIED BY HIS WHOLE COURT MADE HIS APPEARANCE
2104,THE SEASONS ALLIES OF SPRING FOLLOWED HIM CLOSELY TO FORM A QUADRIAL WHICH AFTER MANY WORDS OF MORE OR LESS FLATTERING IMPORT WAS THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE ANTS
2105,HIS LEGS THE BEST SHAKED AT COURT WERE DISPLAYED TO GREAT ADVANTAGE AND FLESH COLORED SILKEN HOSE OF SO FINE AND SO TRANSPORTED THAT IT SEEMED ALMOST LIKE FLESH ITSELF
2106,THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS CARRIAGE WHICH RESEMBLED THE BLIND MOVEMENTS OF AN IMMORTAL AND HE DID NOT DANCE SO MUCH AS SEEMED TO SORE ALONG
2107,YES IT IS SUPPRESSED
2108,FAR FROM IT SIRE YOUR MAJESTY HAD IN GIVEN NO DIRECTIONS ABOUT IT THE MUSICIANS HAVE RETAINED HIM
2109,YES SIRE AND READY DRESSED FOR THE VALET
2110,SIRE HE SAID YOUR MAJESTY'S MOST DEVOTED SERVANT APPROACHES TO PERFORM A SERVICE ON THIS OCCASION WITH SIMILAR ZEAL THAT HE IS ALREADY SHOWN ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE
2111,THE KING SEEMED ONLY PLEASED WITH EVERY ONE PRESENT
2112,MONSIEUR WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO DID NOT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT THE MATTER
2113,THE VALET BEGAN THE EFFECT WAS MORE THAN BEAUTIFUL
2114,WHEN THE MUSIC BY ITS BURSTS OF MELODY CARRIED AWAY THESE ILLUSTRIOUS DANCERS WHEN THE SIMPLE UNTIDERED PANAMINE OF THAT PERIOD ONLY THE MORE NATURAL ON ACCOUNT OF THE VERY INDIFFERENT ACTING OF THE AUGUST ACTORS HAD REACHED ITS COMMONATING POINT OF TRIUMPH
2115,DISTAINFUL OF A SUCCESS OF WHICH MADAME SHOWED NO ACKNOWLEDGMENT HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT BOLDLY REGAINING THE MARKET PREFERENCE OF THE PRINCESS
2116,BY DEGREES ALL HIS HAPPINESS ALL HIS BRILLIANCY SUBSIDED INTO REGRET AND UNEASINESS SO THAT HIS LIMBS LOST THEIR POWER HIS ARMS HUNG HEAVILY BY HIS SIDES AND HIS HEAD DROOPED AS THOUGH HE WAS STUPEFIED
2117,THE KING WHO HAD FROM THE MOMENT BECOME AND REALITY THE PRINCIPAL DANCING THE QUADRIAL CAST A LOOK UPON HIS VANQUISHED RIVAL
2118,EVERY ONE COULD OBSERVE HIS AGITATION AND PROSTRATION A PROSTRATION WHICH WAS INDEED THE MORE REMARKABLE SINCE PEOPLE WERE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO SEE HIM WITH HIS ARMS HANGING LISTLESSLY BY HIS SIDE HIS HEAD BEWILDERED AND HIS EYES WITH ALL THEIR BRIGHT INTELLIGENCE CONDEMNED
2119,UPON THIS MADAME DEIGN TO TURN HER EYES LANGUISHINGLY TOWARDS THE COUNT OBSERVING
2120,WHO DO YOU THINK SO SHE REPLIED WITH INDIFFERENCE
2121,YES THE CHARACTER WHICH YOU ARE ROYAL HIGHNESS ASSUMED IS IN PERFECT HARMONY WITH YOUR OWN
2122,EXPLAIN YOURSELF
2123,I ALLUDE TO THE GODDESS
2124,DE PRINCESS INQUIRED NO
2125,SHE THEN ROSE HUMMING THE AIR TO WHICH SHE WAS PRESENTLY GOING TO DANCE
2126,THE ARROW PURSED HIS HEART AND WOUNDED HIM MORTILY
2127,A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AFTERWARDS HE RETURNED TO THE THEATRE BUT IT WILL BE READILY BELIEVED THAT IT WAS ONLY A POWERFUL EFFORT OF REASON OVER HIS GREAT EXCITEMENT THAT ENABLED HIM TO GO BACK OR PERHAPS FOR LOVE IS THIS STRANGELY CONSTITUTED HE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE EVEN TO REMAIN MUCH LONGER SEPARATED HE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE EVEN TO REMAIN MUCH LONGER CONSTITUTED
2128,WHEN SHE PERCEIVED THE YOUNG MAN SHE ROSE LIKE A WOMAN SURPRISED IN THE MIDST OF IDEAS SHE WAS DESIROUS HAVE CONCEALING FROM HERSELF
2129,REMAIN I IMPLORED YOU THE EVENING IS MOST LOVELY

2156,WHAT US RUN THEN SAID ALL THREE AND GRACEFULLY LIFTING UP THE LONG SKIRTS OF THEIR SOAP DRESSES THEY LIGHTLY RAN ACROSS THE OPEN SPACE BETWEEN THE LAKE AND THE THICKEST COVERED OF THE PARK
2157,IN FACT THE SOUND OF MADAME'S AND THE QUEEN'S CARRIAGES COULD BE HEARD IN THE DISTANCE UPON THE HARD DRY GROUND OF THE ROADS FOLLOWED BY THE MOUNTAIN CAVALIERS
2158,IN THIS WAY THE FED OF THE WHOLE COURT WAS A FIT ALSO FOR THE MYSTERIOUS AND HABITANCE OF THE FOREST FOR CERTAINLY THE DEER IN THE BRIG THE PEASANT ON THE BRANCH THE FOX AND ITS WHOLE WERE ALL LISTENING
2159,ALL ABOUT HIM WAS A TUMULT OF BRIGHT AND BROKEN COLOUR SCATTERED AND BROAD'S BLASHES
2160,THE BRIGANDS ARE HAD A CRESTED HEAD OF EARED DOZEN GREEN BLACK A BROAD COLLAR OF LUSTROUS WHITE BLACK AND WHITE WINGS WHITE BELLY SIGHED FINELY PENNSYLV AND BLACK AND LIGHT AND A BREAST OF WHICH CHASMATE RED STREAKED WITH BLACK
2161,HIS FEET WERE RED HIS LONG NARROW BEAK WITH ITS SALT TOOTH EDGES AND SHARP HOUCHED TIP WAS BRIGHT RED
2162,BUT HERE HE WAS AT A TERRIBLE DISADVANTAGE AS COMPARED WITH THE OWL'S HAWKS AND EAGLES HE HAD NO RENDING LAWS
2163,BUT SUDDENLY STREET AND SWIFT AS A DIE OF ENCUMBERANT HE SHOT DOWN INTO THE TORRENT AND DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE SURFACE
2164,ONCE FAIRLY A WING HOWEVER HE WHEELED MADE BACK HURRIEDLY FOR HIS PART
2165,AND I HAVE SEEN THAT A TROUT OF THIS SIZE WAS A FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL MEAL
2166,BUT SUCH WAS HIS KEENNESS THAT EVEN WELL THE WIDE FLUX OF HIS ENDURED G VICTIM WERE STILL STICKING OUT AT THE CORNERS OF HIS BEAK HIS FEARS FOR RED EYES WERE ONCE MORE PEERING DOWNWARD INTO THE TORRENT AND SUCH A FRESH PREY
2167,A DESPAIR HE HURLED HIMSELF DOWNWARD TOO SOON
2168,THE GREAT HAWK THOU'D HEARDLY TO RETREAT HIS PREY FROM THE GROUND
2169,THE CAT GROWLED SOFTLY THICK UP THE PRIZE AND HER JAWS AND TROTTED IN THE DELICIOUS TO DEVOUR IT
2170,IN FACT HE HAD JUST FINISHED IT THE LAST OF THE CHILD'S TAIL HAD JUST FINISHED WITH THE SPASM DOWN HIS STREAMED GO IT WHEN THE BAFFLED HALT CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM AND STOOPED
2171,THE HAWK ALLATED ON THE DEAD BRANCH AND SAT UP RIGHT MOTIONLESS AS IF SURPRISED
2172,LIKE HIS UNFORTUNATE LITTLE COUSIN THE TAIL HE TOO HAD FELT THE FEAR OF DEATH'S WRITTEN INTO HIS HEART AND WAS HEADING DESPERATELY FOR THE REFUGE OF SOME DARK OVERHANGING BANK DEEP FRINGED WITH WEEDS WERE THE DREADFUL I OF THE HAWK SHOULD NOT DISCERN HIM
2173,THE HAWKS HAD UPON THE BRANCH AND WATCHED HIS QUARRY SWIMMING BENEATH THE SURFACE
2174,ALMOST INSTANTLY YOU AS FORCED TO THE TOP
2175, STRAIGHTWAY IN THE HUT LIGHTED FROM HIS PERCHED AND DARTED AFTER HIM
2176,BUT AT THIS POINT IN THE RAPIDS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO STAY DOWN
2177,BUT THIS FREQUENT SURE OF THE HEIGHTS OF AIR FOR ALL HIS SAVAGE VALOR WAS TROUBLED AT THE LEAPING WAVES AND THE TOSSING FOAM OF THESE MAN RABBITS HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THEM
2178,AS HE FLEW HIS DOWN REACHING TUNES WERE NOT HALF A YARD ABOUT THE FUGITOUS HEAD
2179,WHERE THE WAVES FOR INSTANCE SEEMED THEY CAME CLOSER BUT NOT QUITE WITHIN GRASPING REACH
2180,BUT AS BEFORE THE LEAPING WAVES OF THE RAPIDS WERE TOO MUCH FOR HIS PURSUER AND KNEW ABLE TO FLAP HIS WAY ONWARD IN A CLOUD OF FOAM WHILE DOOMED HUNG LOW ABOVE HIS HEAD YET HESITATED TO STRIKE
2181,THE HAWK EMITTED BY THE LOSS OF HIS FIRST QUARRY HAD BECOME AS DOG AND PURSUIT AS A MUSCLE NOT TO BE SHAKEN OFF OR EVATED OR DECEIVED
2182,HE HAD A LOT OF LINE OUT AND THE PLACE WAS NONE TOO FREE FOR A LONG CAST BUT HE WAS IMPATIENT TO DROP HIS FLIES AGAIN ON THE SPOT WHERE THE BIG FISH WAS FEEDING
2183,THE LAST DROP FLY AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT CAUGHT JUST IN THE CORNER OF THE HAWK'S ANGRILY OPEN BEAT HOPING IT SO FIRMLY
2184,AT THE SUDDEN SHARP STING OF IT THE GREAT BIRD TURNED HIS HEAD AND NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FISHERMAN STANDING ON THE BANK
2185,THE DRAG UPON HIS BEAK AND THE LIGHT CHECK UPON HIS WINGS WERE INEXPLICABLE TO HIM AND APPALLING
2186,THEN THE LEADER PARTED FROM THE LINE
2187,HE IS A WELCOME FIGURE AT THE GARDEN PARTIES OF THE ELECT WHO WERE ALWAYS READY TO ENCOURAGE HIM BY ACCEPTING FREE SEATS FOR HIS PLAY AFTER MANAGERS NOD TO HIM AND HE IS ALLOWED HIM TO CONTRIBUTE WITHOUT CHARGE TO SOME POSTIUM ON THE PRICE OF GULFS
2188,A SHORT HE BECOMES A PROMINENT FIGURE IN ONE OF SOCIETY AND IF HE IS NOT CAREFUL SOMEBODY WILL SAY SO
2189,BUT EVEN THE UNSUCCESSFUL DRAMATIZED HAS HIS MOMENTS
2190,YOU WILL PLAY MUST BE NOT MERELY A GOOD PLAY BUT A SUCCESSFUL ONE
2191,FRINKLY I CANNOT ALWAYS SAY
2192,BUT SUPPOSE YOU SAID I AM FOND OF WRITING MY PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY MY LETTERS HOME OR GOOD ENOUGH FOR PLUNGE
2193,I'VE GOT A LITTLE IDEA FOR A PLAY ABOUT A MAN AND A WOMAN AND ANOTHER WOMAN AND BUT PERHAPS I BETTER KEEP THE POT A SECRET FOR THE MOMENT
2194,ANY HOW WAS A JOLLY EXCITED AND I CAN DO THE DIAL ALL ALL RIGHT
2195,LEND ME OR YEAR FOR TEN MINUTES AND YOU SHALL LEARN JUST WHAT STAGE CRACK IS
2196,AND I SHOULD BEGIN WITH A SHORT HUMBLY ON SO LOW DECLARED
2197,HIM YOU BE OR NOT TO BE
2198,NOW THE OBJECT OF THIS OLLICALLY IS PLAIN
2199,INDEED A RELATION MEAN THE CARED OF HAMLETS SOLILOQUY A CLEVER PLAYER COULD TO SOME EXTENT INDICATED BEHOLD THIRTY LINES BY A SILENT WORKING OF THE JAW BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT WOULD BE IDLE TO DENY THAT HE WOULD MISS THE FINER SHADES OF THE DRAMATICEST MEANING
2200,WE MODERN'S HOWEVER SEE THE ABSURDITY OF IT
2201,IF IT BE GRANTED FIRST THAT THE THOUGHTS OF A CERTAIN CHARACTER SHOULD BE KNOWN TO THE AUDIENCE AND SECONDLY A SOLILOQUY OR THE HABIT OF THINKING ALOUD IS IN OPPOSITION TO MODERN STAGE TECHNIQUE HOWLISCILETE BE AVOIDED WITHOUT DAMAGE TO THE PLAY
2202,AND SO ONE TO LEAD IT THE END ONE OPIALLY MIGHT SAY AH YES WE'RE SOMETHING NON COMMITTED OF THAT SORT
2203,THIS WOULD BE AN EASY WAY OF DOING IT BUT IT WOULD NOT BE THE BEST WAY FOR THE REASON THAT IT IS TOO EASY TO CALL ATTENTION TO ITSELF
2204,AND THE OLD BADLY MADE PLAY IT WAS FREQUENTLY NECESSARY A ONE OF BE CHARACTERS TO TAKE THE AUDIENCE INTO HIS CONFIDENCE
2205,IN THE MODERN WELL CONSTRUCTED PLAY HE SIMPLY BRINGS UP AN IMAGINARY CONFEDERATE AND TELLS HIM WHAT HE IS GOING TO DO COULD ANYTHING BE MORE NATURAL
2206,I WANT DOUBLE NINE PILLOW
2207,DOUBLED NINE TWO THREE ELSINOR BUT DOUBLE NOT YES HOMO EVA YOU RACIAL PAMOUS SPEAKING
2208,I SAY I'M FOR WANDERING ABOUT THIS BUSINESS

2210,YOU GAVE ME DOUBLE FIVE I WON'T DOUBLE NINE HELL IS THAT YOU HORACEO HAMLET'S BEATING
2211,YOU BE OR NOT TO BE THAT IS THE QUESTION WHETHER TIS NOBLER
2212,IT IS TO AT HAMLET IF THAT HAPPENED TO BE THE NAME OF YOUR CHARACTER ENJOYLY SMALL DOG HAD BROKEN MONGERS TAME BEAR WHATEVER ANIMAL IS MOST IN KEEPING WITH THE PART AND CONFIDE IN THIS ANIMAL SUCH SORROWS HOPES OR SECRET HISTORY AS THE AUDIENCE HAS GOT TO NOW
2213,INTER HAMLET WITH HIS FAVOURITE BOREHOUND
2214,LADY LARGE BURST OR SUDDENLY IN TRINCEWORD HIM
2215,L OUR SPUR BID ME AGAIN THIS MORNING FOR THE THIRD TIME
2216,I WANT YOU GET AWAY FROM IT ALL SWOON
2217,ENTURED LORD ARTHUR FALKON AS
2218,AND THERE YOU ARE YOU WILL OF COURSE APPRECIATE THAT THE UNFENDER SERVICES NOT ONLY SAVE TIME BUT ALSO MAKE THE MANOEERING VERY MUCH MORE NATURAL
2219,HOW YOU MAY BE WONDERING ARE YOU TO BEGIN YOUR MASTERPIECE
2220,WE'D LAPSE IN BESIDES FOR THE REST OF THE EVENING
2221,THE LETTERS OF SOUTH BRIDGE TO LORD READY OH READY WHAT DID YOU SAY
2222,THEN LORD COMPANY WON'T WHAT ABOUT OXEN
2223,DEASE OFF LEAPING THE HERO AND HEROINE ALONE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STAGE AND THEN YOU CAN AGAIN
2224,THIS IS THE TOUCH INTRODUCED A MEAL ON THE STAGE
2225,A STAGE MEAL IS POPULAR BECAUSE IT PROVED TO THE AUDIENCE OF THE ACTORS EVEN ONE CALLED CHARLES WHOLE TREE OR ELEANOR'S ARE REAL PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOU IN MEAN
2226,TE PLEASE MATTERS BUTLER IMPRESSIVELY
2227,HOTUS REPLACES LUMP AND INCLINES EMPTY POT OVER TRADE FOR A MOMENT THEN HANDS TO MAKE UP PAINTED BROWN INSIDE HOSTY SEALING THE GENTLEMAN WITH THE TAILS OPEN THE UPPER CIRCLE
2228,REANCIALLY AND THE THREE FOOTMEN WHO MOVED THE TEA THINGS HOUSES TO GUEST
2229,AND NOVELS THE YEAR HIS OFTEN PUSHED HIS MEALS AWAY UNTASTED BUT NO EXIGURE WOULD DO ANYTHING SO A NATURAL AS THIS
2230,TWO WHITES ARE MADE AND THE BREAD IS CRUMBLED WITH A NARROW OF GREAT EAGERNESS INDEED ONE FEELS THAT IN REAL LIFE THE GAS WOULD BE CLUTCH HOLD OF THE FOOTMEN AND SAY HALF A MOLD CHAP I HAVE IT NEARLY FINISHED BUT THE ACTORS BITTER SCHOOL BUSINESS
2231,BUT IT IS A CIGARETTE WHICH CHIEFLY HAS BROUGHT THE MODERN DRAMA TO ITS PRESENT STATE AT PERFECTION
2232,LEAR JOHN TOOK ME OUT GOLD CIGARETTE CASE FROM HIS LEFT HAND UPPER WAISTCOAT'S POCKET
2233,THE BOLDEST LEGISLATURE NUMBERED THIRTY SIX MEMBERS
2234,THIS WAS AT THE MARCH ELECTION EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE
2235,THAT SUMMER'S EMIGRATION HOWEVER BEING MAINLY FROM THE FIRST DAYS GREATLY CHANGED THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF THE TWO PARTIES
2236,FOR GENERAL SERVICE THEREFORE REQUIRING NO SPECIAL EFFORT THE NUMEROUS STRENGTH OF THE FACTIONS WAS ABOUT EQUAL WHILE ON EXTRA ORDINARY OCCASIONS THE TWO THOUSAND BORDARTHIAN RESERVE LYING A LITTLE FARTHER BACK FROM THE STATE LINE COULD AT ANY TIME EASILY TURN THE STATE LINE COULD AT ANY TIME EASILY TURN THE SCALE
2237,THE FREE STATE MEN HAD ONLY THEIR CONVICTIONS THEIR INTELLIGENCE THEIR COURAGE AND THE MORAL SUPPORT OF THE NORTH THE CONSPIRACY HAD ITS SECRET COMBINATION THE TERRITORYAL FICTS THE LEGISLATOR THE BOLDEST LAWS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE LORDS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE COURTS THE
2238,THIS WAS A FORMIDABLE ARRAY OF ADVANTAGES SLAVERY WAS PLAYING WITH LOADED DIES
2239,COMING BY WAY OF THE MISERY RIVER TOWNS HE FELL FIRST AMONG BORDARTHIAN COMPANIONS AND PERHAPS HAVING HIS INCLINATIONS ALREADY MOLDED BY HIS WASHINGTON INSTRUCTIONS HIS EARLY IMPRESSIONS WERE DECIDEDLY ATVERSE TO THE FREE STATE CAUSE
2240,HIS RECEPTION SPEECH AT WESTPORT IN WHICH HE MAINTAINED THE LEGALITY OF THE LEGISLATOR AND HIS DETERMINATION TO ENFORCE THEIR LAWS DELIGHTED HIS PERSONALLY RODATORS
2241,ALL THE TERRITORYAL DIGNITARIES WERE PRESENT GIVEN HER HAND AND PRESIDED JOHN KATHERINE THE SURVEYAR GENERAL MADE THE PRINCIPAL SPEECH A DENUNCIATION OF THE ABOLITIONIST SUPPORTING THAT TO BE THE MOVEMENT SHE OF JUSTICE LECOQIGNED BY THE OCCASION WITH APPROVING REMARKS
2242,ALL DESCENT ON UNCOMPLINES ALL HESITATION ALL MERE SILENCE EVEN WERE IN THEIR STRONGHOLD TOWNS LIKE LEVIN WORK RENDERED AS ABOLITIONISM DECLARED TO BE HOSTILITY TO THE PUBLIC WELFARE AND HIGHEST WITH PRESCRIPTIONAL VIOLENCE EXPULSION AND FREQUENTLY DEATH
2243,OF THE LENTINGS THE MOBS AND THE MURDERS IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE EXCEPT IN A VERY EXTENDED WORK TO NOTE THE FREQUENT AND PATRICIUS DETAILS
2244,THE PRESENT CHAPTERS CAN ONLY TOUCH UPON THE MORE SAILING AT MOVEMENTS OF THE CIVIL WAR IN KANSAS WHICH HAPPILY ARE NOT SANGUINEARY IF HOWEVER THE INDIVIDUAL AND MORE ISOLATED CASES OF BLOOD SHED TO BE DESCRIBED THEY WOULD SHOW A STARTLING ADDER IT OF BARBARITY AND A LOSS OF LIFE FOR OPINION'S SAKE
2245,SEVER HUNDRED FEET EIGHT MEN PROMPTLY RESPONDED TO THE SUMMONS
2246,IT WASN'T FACT THE BEST WEAPON OF ITS DAY
2247,THE LEADERS OF THE CONSPIRACY BECAME DISTRUSTFUL OF THEIR POWER TO CRUSH THE TOWN
2248,ONE OF HIS MOLLISH A GENERAL'S SUGGESTED THAT THE GOVERNOR SHOULD REQUIRE THE OUTLAWS AT FLORENCE AND ELSEWHERE TO SURRENDER THE SHARP'S RIFLES ANOTHER ROAD ASKING HIM TO CALL OUT THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS AT FOUR LEVINWORTH
2249,THE GOVERNOR ON HIS PART BECOMING DOUBTFUL OF THE LEGALITY OF EMPLOYING MISERY TO ENFORCE KANSAS LAWS WAS ALSO EAGER TO SECURE THE HEALTH OF FEDERAL TROOPS
2250,SIR JONES HAD HIS POCKETS ALWAYS FULL OF WRITS IS SHOULD IN THE SPIRIT OF PERSECUTION THAT WAS OFTEN BAFFLED BY THE SHARP WITS AND READY RESOURCES OF THE FREE STATE PEOPLE AND SOMETIMES DEFIED OUTRIGHT
2251,LITTLE BY LITTLE HOWEVER THE LATTER BECAME HUMMED AND BOUND IN THE MASSES OF THE VARIOUSLY VICES AND PROCEEDINGS WHICH THE TERRITORYAL FISSURES INVOLVED FROM THE BOGUOUS LAWS
2252,TO EMBARRASS THIS DAMAGING EXPOSURE JUDGE LECOQ ISSUED A WRIT AGAINST THE EX GOVERNOR ON A FRIVOLOUS CHARGE OF CONTEMPT
2253,THE INCIDENT WAS NOT VIOLENT NOR EVEN DRAMATIC NO POSSE WAS SUMMON NO FURTHER EFFORT MADE AND READER FEARING PERSONAL VIOLENCE SOON LED IN DISGUISE
2254,BUT THE AFFAIR WAS MAGNIFIED AS A CROWNING PROOF THAT THE FREE STATE MEN WERE INSURRECTIONOUS AND OUTLAWS
2255,FROM THESE AGAIN SPRANG BARRICADED AND FORTIFIED DWELLINGS CAMPS AND SCOUT PARTIES FINALLY CULMINATING IN ROVING GIRL OF BANDS HALF PARTIS AND HALF PREDATORY
2256,THEIR DISTINCT CHARACTERS HOWEVER DISPLAYED ONE BROAD AND UNFAILING DIFFERENCE
2257,THE FREE STATE MEN CLUNG TO THEIR PRAIRIE TOWNS AND PRAYER VEINS WITH ALL THE OBSTINACY AND COURAGE OF TREATY FINDERS OF THEIR HOMES AND FIRE SIDES
2258,THEIR ASSUMED CHARACTER CHANGED WITH THEIR CHANGING OPPORTUNITIES OR NECESSITIES
2259,IN THE SHOOTING OF SCHERAS JONES AND LOANS AND IN THE REFUSAL OF EXCAVANER READER TO ALLOW THE DEBUTY MARSHAL TO ARREST HIM THEY DISCOVERED GRAVE OFFENCES AGAINST THE TERRITORYAL AND THE UNITED STATES LAWS
2260,FIT NOTE SUMMER TO SHANNAN MAKE TWELVE EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX
2261,CRIED PERSONS WHO AT LEAST THE FREE STATE HOTEL VAINLY BESOUGHT THE VARIOUS AUTHORITIES TO PRESENT THE DESTRUCTION OF THEIR PROPERTY
2262, TEN DAYS WERE CONCERNED IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS BUT THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE REFUSED TO YIELD
2263,HE SUMMONED HALF A DOZEN CITIZENS TO JOIN HIS POSSE WHO FOLLOWED A MAID AND ASSISTED HIM
2264,HE CONTINUED HIS PRETENDED SEARCH AND TO GIVE COLOR TO HIS ERRAND MADE TO ARREST
2265,THE FREE STATE HOTEL A STONE BUILDING IN DIMENSIONS FIFTY BY SEVENTY FEET THREE STORIES HIGH AND HANDSOMELY FURNISHED PREVIOUSLY OCCUPIED ONLY FOR LODGING ROOMS ON THAT DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME OPENED ITS TABLE ACCOMMODATIONS TO THE PUBLIC AND PROVIDED A FREE DINNER OF THE OCCASION
2266,AS HE HAD PROMISED TO PROTECT THE HOTEL THE REASSURED CITIZENS BEGAN TO LAUGH AT THEIR OWN FEARS
2267,TO THEIR SORROW THEY WERE SOON UNDECEIVED
2268,THE MILITARY FORCE PARTLY RABBLE PARTLY ORGANIZED HAD BEEN WHILE MOVED INTO THE TOWN
2269,HE PLANED AT COMPANY BEFORE THE HOTEL AND DEMANDED A SURRENDER OF THE ARMS BELONGING TO THE FREE STATE MILITARY COMPANIES
2270,HALF AN HOUR LATER TURNING A DEATH EAR TO ALL REMONSTRANCE HE GAVE THE PROPRIETORS UNTIL FIVE O'CLOCK TO REMOVE THEIR FAMILIES AND PERSONAL PROPERTY FROM THE FREE SATEOTTO
2271,ATSON WHO HAD BEEN HURRYING THE MOB PLANTED HIS TWO GUNS BEFORE THE BUILDING AND TRAINED THEM UPON
2272,THE ENNATES BEING REMOVED AT THE APPOINTED HOUR A FEW CANNONS WERE FIRED TO THE STONE WALLS
2273,IN THIS INCIDENT CONTRASTING THE CREATED AND THE DISTRACTED SPIRIT OF THE FACTIONS THE EMIGAN AGE SOCIETY OF MASSACHUSEES FINDS ITS MOST HONORABLE AND TRIUMPH AND DEDICATION
2274,THE WHOLE PRECEDING WAS SO CHILDISH THE MISERABLE PLOT SO TRANSPARENT THE OUTRAGE SO GROSS AS TO BRING DISCUSSED TO THE BETTER CLASS OF BORDER RUFFIANS WHO WERE WITNESSES AND SUCCESSARIES
2275,WE KNOWCATED FOOTNOTE GOVERNOR ROBINSON BEING ON HIS WAY EAST THE STEAM BOAT ON WHICH HE WAS TRAVELLING STOPPED AT LIKING TO MISERY
2276,IN A FEW DAYS AN OFFICER CAME WITH A REQUISITION FROM GOVERNOR SHANNAN AND TOOK THE PRISONER BY LAND A WEST PORT AND AFTERWARDS FROM THERE TO CAN THE CITY AND LEVINWORTH
2277,HAIRY WAS PLACE IN THE CASCITY OF CAPTAIN MARTIN OF THE KICOTUS WHO PROVED A KIND JAILER AND MATERIALLY ASSISTED AND PROTECTING HIM FROM THE DANGEROUS INTENTIONS OF THE MOB WHICH AT THAT TIME HELD LEVIN WORTH UNDER THE REIGN OF TERROR
2278,CAPTAIN MARTIN SAID I SHALL GIVE YOU A PISTOL TO HELP PROTECT YOURSELF IF WORSE COMES TO WORST
2279,IN THE EARLY MORNING OF THE NEXT DAY MAY TWENTY NINE A COMPANY OF DRAGGINS WITH ONE EMPTY SADDLE CAME DOWN FROM THE FORT AND WHILE THE COAST LABOUR MEN STILL SLEPT THE PRISONER AND HIS ESCORT WERE ON THEIR WAY ACROSS THE PRAYERS OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY
2280,THOUGH THROWNING TO PRISON FOR THIS ENTERPRISE AND DETAINED SOME TIME HE WAS NOT DISCOURAGED BUT STILL CONTINUED BY HIS COUNTENANCE AND PROTECTION TO INFUSE SPIRIT INTO THE DISTRESSED VIOLENCE
2281,AMONG NEITHER PERSONS OF DISTINCTION WHO UNITED THEMSELVES TO HIM WAS LORD NAPIER OF PROTESTANT SON OF THE FAMOUS INVENTOR OF THE LOGARTHMS THE PASSING TO WHOM THE TITLE OF A GREAT MAN IS MORE JUSTLY DUE
2282,WHILE THE FORMER FORETOLD THAT THE SCOTTISH COVENANTAS WERE SECRETLY FORMING A UNION WITH THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT AND INCOCATED THE NECESSITY OF PREVENTING THEM BY SOME VIGOROUS AND TO TAKING THE LATTER STILL INSISTED THAT EVERY SUCH A TENT WOULD PRECIPITATE
2283,A KING'S EARS WERE NOW OPENED TO MONROZ'S COUNSELS COUNSELS WHO PROPOSED NONE BUT THE BOLDEST AND MOST DARING AGREEABLE TO THE DESPERATE STATE OF THE ROYAL COALS IN SCOTLAND
2284,FIVE HUNDRED MEN MORE WHO HAD BEEN LEVE'D BY THE CONVENTORS WERE PERSUADED TO EMBRACE THE ROYAL COALS AND WITH THIS COMBINED FORCE HE HASTENED TO ATTACK NOR'D KATH WITH AN ARMY OF SIX THOUSAND MEN ASSEMBLED UPON THE FIRST NEWS OF SIX THOUSAND MEN ASSEMBLED UPON THE FIRST THOUSAND MEN ASSEMBLED UPON THE FIRST THOUSAND MEN ASSEMBLED MEN ASSEMBLED UPON THE FIRST THOUSAND MEN ASSEMBLED MEN ASSEMBLED UPON THE FIRST THOUSAND MEN ASSEMBLED UPON THE FIRST THOUSAND MEN ASSEMBLED UPON THE FIRST THOUSAND MEN ASSEMBLED UPON THE FIRST THOUSAND MEN ASSEMBLED MEN ASSEMBLED UPON THE FIRST THOUSAND MEN ASSEMBLED UPON THE FIRST THOUSAND MEN ASSEMBLED UPON THE FIRST THOUSAND MEN ASSEMBLED
2285,DRAGGING THE SUPERIOR POWER OF ARGYLE WHO HAVING JOINED HIS VASSALS TO A FORCE LEVEDIED BY THE PUBLIC WAS APPROACHING WITH A CONSIDERABLE ARMY MONROE'S HASTENED NORTHWARD IN ORDER TO ROUSE AGAIN THE MOCKY OF HUMPHREY AND THE MARQUIS OF HUMPHLY AND THE MORTONS
2286,THIS NOBLEMAN'S CHARACTER THOUGH CELEBRATED FOR POLITICAL COURAGE AND CONDUCT WAS VERY LOW FOR MILITARY PROWESS AND AFTER SOME SKIRMISHES IN WHICH HE WAS WORSTED HE HERE ALOUD MONROE'S TO ESCAPE HIM
2287,BY QUICK MARCHED THROUGH THESE INEXESIBLE MOUNTAINS BUT GENERAL FREED HIMSELF FROM THE SUPERIOR FORCES OF THE CONVENTORS
2288,WITH THESE AND SOME REENFORCEMENTS OF THE ETHEL MEN AND BUT DONNELS WHOM HE HAD RECALLED MONSTERS FELL SUDDENLY UPON OUR GUILE'S COUNTRY AND LET LOOSE UPON IT ALL THE RAGE OF WAR CARING OF THE CATTLE BURNING THE HOUSES AND PUTTING THE INHABITANTS TO THE SWORD
2289,THIS SEVERITY BY WHICH MONROE'S SALTE HIS VICTORIES WAS THE RESULT OF PRIVATE AND EMOTION AGAINST THE CHIEFTAIN AS MUCH AS OF ZEAL FOR THE PUBLIC COALS OUR GUILE COLLECTING THREE THOUSAND MEN MARCHED IN QUEST OF THE ENEMY WHO HAD RETIRED WITH THEIR PLUNDERED MEN MARCHED IN QUEST OF THE ENEMY MUCH IN QUEST OF THE ENEMY MARCHED IN QUEST OF THE ENEMY MUCH IN QUEST OF THE ENEMY MUCH IN QUEST OF THE ENEMY MUCH IN QUEST OF THE ENEMY MUCH IN QUEST OF THE ENEMY MUCH IN QUEST OF THE ENEMY WHO HAD RETIRED MEN MARCHED IN QUEST OF THE ENEMY WHO HAD
2290,BY A QUICK AND UNEXPECTED MARCH WHEN TROWS HASTENED TO INNER LUCKY AND PRESENTED HIMSELF IN ORDER OF BATTLE BEFORE THE SURPRISED BUT NOT A FRIGHTENED COVENANTERS
2291,HIS CONDUCT AND PRESENCE OF MIND IN THE EMERGIANS APPEARED CONSPICUOUS
2292,MON TROWS WEAK IN CAVALRY HERE LINE HIS TROOPS OF HORSE WITH INFANT TREE AND AFTER PUTTING THE ENEMY'S HORSE TO ROUTE FELL WITH UNITED FORCE UPON THEIR FOOT WHO WERE ENTIRELY CUT IN PIECES THERE WITH THE LOSS OF THE GORDON ON THE PART OF THE ROLISDENS
2293,FROM THE SAME MEN NEW REGIMENTS AND NEW COMPANIES WERE FORMED DIFFERENT OFFICERS APPOINTED AND THE WHOLE MILITARY FORCE PUT INTO SUCH HANDS AS THE INDEPENDENCE COULD RELY ON
2294,BESIDES MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WHO WERE EXCLUDED MANY OFFICERS UNWILLING TO SERVE UNDER THE NEW GENERALS THREW UP THEIR COMMISSIONS AND THEN RARELY FACILITATED THE PROJECT OF PUTTING THE ARMY ENTIRELY INTO THE HANDS OF THAT FACTION
2295,THAT THE DISCIPLINE OF THE FORMER PARLIAMENTARY ARMY WAS NOT CONTEMPTIBLE A MORE EXACT PLAN WAS INTRODUCED AND RIGOROUSLY EXECUTED BY THESE NEW COMMANDERS
2296,VALA INDEED WAS VERY GENERALLY DIFFUSED OVER THE ONE PARTY AS WELL AS THE OTHER HEARING THIS PERIOD DISCIPLINE ALSO WAS ATTAINED BY THE FORCES OF THE PARLIAMENT BUT THE PERFECTION OF THE MINUTARY ART IN CONCERTING THE GENERAL PLANS OF ACTION
2297, HISTORIANS AT LEAST PERHAPS FROM THEIR OWN IGNORANCE AND INEXPERIENCE HAVE NOT REMARKED ANYTHING BUT AHEAD LONG IN PICTURESQUE CONDUCT EACH PARTY HARDING TO A BATTLE WHERE VALOR AND FORTUNE CHIEFLY DETERMINE THE SUCCESS
2298,HE PASSED THROUGH A HANDY SIT ALBAN'S AND CAME SO NEAR TO LONDON AS HARROW OWN HILL
2299,THE SCOTTISH GENERAL AND COMMISSION AS AFFECTED GREAT SURPRISE ON THE APPEARANCE OF THE KING AND THOUGH THEY PAID HIM ONLY EXTERIOR RESPECT DO TO HIS DIGNITY THEY INSTANTLY SIT A GOD UPON HIM UNDER COLOR OF PROTECTION AND MAY HIM IN REALITY A PRISONER
2300,THEY INFORMED ENGLISH PARLIAMENT OF THIS UNEXPECTED INCIDENT AND ASSURED THEM THAT THEY HAD ENTERED INTO NO PRIVATE TREATY WITH THE KING
2301,OR HA HE GIVEN US ANY GIFT
2302,AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL ANSWERED THE MEN OF JUDAH AND SAID WE HAVE TEN POTS IN THE KING AND WE HAVE ALSO MORE RIGHT IN DAVID THAN YE WHY THEN DID GENIE SPIES US THAT OUR ADVICE SHOULD NOT BE FIRST HEAD IN BRINGING BACK OUR KING
2303,ANOTHER PREACHER AFTER REPROACHING HIM TO HIS FACE WITH HIS MISS GOVERNMENT OR DID THIS SOUND TO BE SO
2304,THE KING STOOD UP AND CALLED FOR THAT SONG WHICH BEGINS WITH THESE WORDS
2305,HAVE MERCY LORD ON ME I PRAY FOR MEN WOULD ME DEVOUR
2306,THE GOOD NATURED AUDIENCE IN PITY TO FALL AND MAJESTY SHOWED FOR ONE BRIGHTER DIFFERENCE TO THE KING THEN TO THE MINISTER AND SONG THE SONG WHICH THE FORMER HAD GOLDFUL
2307,THE PARLIAMENT AND THE SCOTLAND MADE THEIR PROPOSALS BEFORE THE KING
2308,BEFORE THE SETTLEMENT OF TERMS THE ADMINISTRATION MUST BE POSSESSED ENTIRELY BY THE PARLIAMENTS OF BOTH KINGDOMS AND HOW INCOMPATIBLE THAT SCHEME WITH THE LIBERTY OF THE KING IS EASILY IMAGINED
2309,THE ENGLISH IT IS EVIDENT HAD THEY NOT BEING PREVIOUSLY ASSURED OF RECEIVING THE KING WOULD NEVER HAVE PARTED WITH SO CONSIDERABLE A SUM AND WHILE THEY WEAKEN THEMSELVES BY THE SAME MEASURE HAVE STRENGTH AND TO PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY MUST AFTERWARDS
2310,IF ANY STILL RETAIN RANKON AGAINST HIM IN HIS PRESENT CONDITION THEY PASSED IN SILENCE WHILE HIS WELL WISHES MORE GENEROUS THAN PRUDENT ACCOMPANIED HIS MARCH WITH TEARS AND WITH PRAYERS AND WITH PRAYERS FOR HIS SAFETY
2311,HIS DEATH IN THIS CONJUNCTURE WAS A PUBLIC MISFORTUNE
2312,THE ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE WILL OCCUPY US UNTIL THE END OF THE THIRTEEN LECTURE AND IS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF OUR WHOLE ENTERPRISE
2313,WHAT IS CALLED PERCEPTIONS FROM SENSATION BY THE FACT THAT THE SENSATIONAL INGREDIENTS BRING UP HABITUAL ASSOCIATES IMAGES AND EXPECTATIONS OF THEIR USUAL CORRELATES ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECTIVELY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SENSATION
2314,WHETHER NOT THIS PRINCIPLE IS LIABLE TO ACCEPTIONS EVERY ONE WOULD AGREE THAT IT HAS A BROAD MEASURE OF TRUTH THOUGH THE WORD EXACTLY MIGHT SEEM AN OVER STATEMENT AND IT MIGHT SEEM MORE CORRECT TO SAY THAT I IT IS A PROXIMATELY REPRESENT IMPRESSIONS
2315,AND WHAT A SORT OF EVIDENCE IS LOGICALLY POSSIBLE
2316,THERE IS NO LOGICAL IMPOSSIBILITY AND THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE WORLD SPRING INTO BEING FIVE MINUTES AGO EXACTLY AS IT IN WAS WITH THE POPULATION THAT REMEMBERED A HOLY UNWIELD PAST
2317,ALL THAT I AM DOING IS TO USE IT'S LODGINGS AS A HELP IN THE ANALYSIS OF WHAT OCCURS WHEN WE REMEMBER
2318,THAT BEHAVIOUR US TO ATTEMPTS TO MAKE PSYCHOLOGY A RECORD OF BEHAVIOUR HAS TO TRUST HIS MEMORY IN MAKING THE RECORD
2319, HABIT IS A CONCEPT INVOLVING THE OCCURRENCE OF SIMILAR EVENTS AT DIFFERENT TIMES IF THE BEHABURIST DOES CONFIDENT THAT THERE IS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS HABIT THAT AN ONLY BE BECAUSE HE TRUSTS HIS MEMORY WHEN IT ASSURES HIM THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER TIMES
2320,BUT I DO NOT THINK SUCH AN INTERFERENCE IS WARRANTED
2321,OUR CONFIDENCE OR LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE ACCURACY OF A MEMORY IMAGE MUST AND FUNDAMENTAL CASES BE BASED UPON A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE IMAGE ITSELF SINCE WE CANNOT EVOKE THE PAST BODILY AND COMPARE IT WITH THE PRESENT IMAGE
2322,WE SOMETIMES HAVE IMAGES THAT ARE BINDINGS PECULIARLY VAGUE WHICH YET WE DO NOT TRUST FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FATIGUE WE MAY SEE A FRIEND'S FACE VIVIDLY AND CLEARLY DISTORTED
2323,SOME IMAGES LIKE SOME SENSATIONS FEEL VERY FAMILIAR WHILE OTHERS FEEL STRANGE
2324,THE MILIARITY IS A FILLING CAPABLE OF DEGREE
2325,IN AN IMAGE OF A WELL KNOWN FACE FOR EXAMPLE SOME PARTS MAY FEEL MORE FAMILIAR THAN OTHERS WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE HAVE MORE BELIEF IN THE ACCURACY OF THE FAMILIAR PARTS THAN IN THAT OF THE UNFAMILIER PARTS
2326,I COME NOW TO THE OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MEMORY IMAGES MUST HAVE IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
2327,THEY MUST HAVE SOME CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MAKES US REGARD THEM AS REFRAIN TO MORALESS REMOTE PORTIONS OF THE PAST
2328,IN ACTUAL FACT THERE ARE JEALOUS VARIOUS FACTORS THAT CONCUR IN GIVING US THE FEELING OF GREATER OR LESS REMOTENESS AND SOME REMEMBERED EVENT
2329,THERE MAY BE A SPECIFIC FILLING WHICH COULD BE CALLED THE FILLING OF PASTNESS ESPECIALLY WHERE IMMEDIATE MEMORY IS CONCERNED
2330,THERE IS OF COURSE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWING THE TEMPORAL RELATION OF A REMEMBERED EVENT TO THE PRESENT AND KNOWING THE TIME ORDER OF TWO REMEMBERED EVENTS
2331,IT WOULD SEEM THAT ONLY RATHER RECENT EVENTS CAN BE PLACED AT ALL ACCURATELY BY MEANS OF FEELINGS GIVING THEIR TEMPORAL RELATION TO THE PRESENT BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH FEELINGS MUST PLAY IN A CENTRAL PART IN THE PROCESS OF DATING REMEMBERED EVENTS
2332,IF WE HAD RETAINED THE SUBJECT OR AT IN KNOWLEDGE THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF MEMORY WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE
2333,REMEMBERING HAS TO BE AT PRESENT OCCURRENCE AND SOME WAY RESEMBLING OR LIGHTED TO WHAT IS IT REMEMBERED
2334,SOME POINTS MAY BE TAKEN AS FIXED AND SUCH AS ANY THEORY OF MEMORY MUST ARRIVE AT
2335,IN THIS CASE AS IN MOST OTHERS WHAT MAY BE TAKEN A CERTAIN AND ADVANCE IS RATHER VAGUE
2336,THE FIRST OF OUR VAGUE BUT INDUBITABLE DATA IS THAT THERE IS KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
2337,WE MIGHT PROVISIONALLY THOUGH PERHAPS NOT QUITE CORRECTLY DEFINE MEMORY AS THAT WAY OF KNOWING ABOUT THE PAST WHICH HAS NO ANALOGUEG IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FUTURE SUCH A DEFINITION WOULD AT LEAST SERVE TO MARK THE PROBLEM WITH WHICH WE ARE CONCERNED THOUGH SOME EXPECTATIONS MAY TO SERVE A DEFINITION
2338,THIS DISENCHION IS VITAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF MEMORY BUT IT IS NOT SO EASY TO CARRY OUT IN PRACTICE AS IT IS TO DRAW IN THEORY
2339,A GRANDMA FOUND BY THE HELP OF SUITABLE RECORDS MIGHT RELATE TO US THE INCIDENTS OF ITS PAST AND PEOPLE ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM GRATIFYING AS THEY LIKE TO BELIEVE
2340,I CONSENT TO WORK NOW TO REMEMBER THINGS I NEVER REMEMBER BEFORE SUCH AS WHAT I HAD TO EAT FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING AND IT CAN HARDLY BE WHOLLY HABIT THAT NAILS ME TO DO THIS
2341,THE FACT THAT A MAN CAN RECITE A POEM DOES NOT SHOW THAT HE REMEMBERS ANY PREVIOUS OCCASION ON WHICH HE HAS RECITED OR READ IT
2342,SIMMONS TWO BOOKS MENTIONED IN AN EARLIER LECTURE DO NOT TOUCH KNOWLEDGE MEMORY AT ALL CLOSELY
2343,THEY GIVE LAWS ACCORDING TO WHICH IMAGES OF PAST OCCURRENCES COME INTO OUR MINDS BUT DO NOT DISCUSS OUR BELIEVE THAT THESE IMAGES REFER TO PASS OCCURRENCES WHICH HAS WHAT CONSTITUTES GNAWEGE MEMORY
2344,IT IS THIS THAT IS EVINURES TO THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE
2345,IT IS BY NO MEANS ALWAYS RELIABLE ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS AT SOME TIME EXPERIENCED THE WELL KNOWN ILLUSION THAT ALL THAT IS HAPPENING NOW HAPPENED BEFORE AT SOME TIME
2346,WHENEVER THE SENSE OF FAMILIAR TO OCCURS WITHOUT A DEFINITE OBJECT IT LEAST US TO SEARCH THE ENVIRONMENT UNTIL WE ARE SATISFIED THAT WE HAVE FOUND THE APPROPRIATE OBJECT WHICH LEAD US TO THE JUDGMENT THIS IS FAMILIAR
2347,THUS NO KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE PAST IS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE FEELING OF FAMILIARITY ALONE
2348,A FURTHER STAGE IS RECOGNITION
2349,RECOGNITION IN THIS SENSE DOES NOT NECESSARILY INVOLVE MORE THAN A HABIT OF A ASSOCIATION THE KIND OF OBJECT WE ARE SEEN AT THE MOMENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORD CAT OR WITH AN AUTITORY IMAGE OF PURRING OR WHATEVER OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WE MAY HAPPEN TO RECOGNIZE IN THE CAT
2350,WE ARE OF COURSE AND FACT ABLE TO JUDGE WHEN WE RECOGNIZE AN OBJECT THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE BUT THIS JUDGMENT IS SOMETHING OVER AND ABOVE RECOGNITION AND THIS FIRST SENSE AND MAY VERY PROBABLY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ANIMALS THAT NEVERTHELESS HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF RECOGNITION
2351,THIS KNOWLEDGE IS MEMORY AND ONE SINCE THOUGH IN ANOTHER IT IS NOT
2352,THERE ARE HOWEVER SEVERAL POINTS IN WHICH SUCH AN ACCOUNT OF RECOGNITION IS IN ADEQUATE TO BEGIN WITH IT MIGHT SEEM A FIRST SIGHT MORE CORRECT TO DEFINE RECOGNITION AS I HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE THEN AS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE
2353,THE DEFINITION OF MY EXPERIENCE IS DIFFICULT BROADLY SPEAKING IT IS EVERYTHING THAT IS CONNECTED WITH WHAT I AM EXPERIENCED NOW BY CERTAIN LENGTH OF WHICH THE VARIOUS FORMS OF MEMORY ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT
2354,THUS IF I RECOGNIZE A THING THE OCCASION OF ITS PREVIOUS EXISTENCE IN VIRTUE OF WHICH I RECOGNIZED IT FORMS PART OF MY EXPERIENCE BY DEFINITION WILL BE ONE OF THE MARKS BY WHICH MY EXPERIENCE IS SINGLE OUT FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD
2355,OF COURSE THE WORDS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE ARE A VERY INADEQUATE TRANSLATION OF WHAT AXIALLY HAPPENS WHEN WE FORM A JUDGMENT OF RECOGNITION BUT THAT IS UNAVOIDABLE WORDS ARE FRAMED TO EXPRESS A LEVEL OF THOUGHT WHICH IS BY NO MEANS PRIMITIVE
2356,I REMAINED THERE ALONE FOR MANY HOURS BUT I MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BEFORE I LEFT THE CHAMBERS I HAD GRADUALLY BROUGHT MYSELF TO LOOK AT THE MATTER IN ANOTHER LIGHT

2595,I SIT BENEATH THY LOOKS AS CHILDREN DO IN THE NOON SUN WITH SOULS THAT TREMBLE THROUGH THEIR HAPPY ISLANDS FROM AN UNAVOURED YET PROBABLE INWARD JOY
2596,I DID NOT WRONG MYSELF SO BUT I PLACED A WRONG ON THEE
2597,WHEN CALLED BEFORE I TOLD HOW HASTILY I DROPPED MY FLOWERS WERE BREAK OFF FROM A GAME
2598,SHALL I NEVER MISS HOME TALK AND BLESSING AND THE COMMON KISS THAT COMES TO EACH IN TURN NOR COUNTED STRANGE WHEN I LOOK UP TO DROP ON A NEW RANGE OF WALLS AND FLOORS ANOTHER HOME THAN THIS
2599,ALAS I HAVE GRIEVED SO I AM HARD TO LOVE
2600, OPEN THY HEART WIDE AND FOLLED WITHIN THE WET WINGS OF THY DOVE
2601,COULD IT MEAN TO LAST THE LOVE SET HANDULANCE BETWEEN SORROW AND SORROW
2602,NAY I RATHER THRILLED DISTRESSING EVERY LIGHT THAT SEEMED TO GUILTY ONWARD PATH AND FEAR TO OVER LEAN A FINGER EVEN
2603,AND THOUGH I HAVE GROWN SERENE AND STRONG SINCE THEN I THINK THAT GOD HAS WILL A STILL RENEWALFUL FEAR
2604,OH LOVE O TROUGHS
2605,AND LOVE BE FALSE
2606,IF HE TO KEEP ONE OATH MUST LOSE ONE JOY BY HIS LIFE'S STAR FOR TOLD
2607,SLOW TO WORLD GREETINGS QUICK WITH ITS OH LIST WHEN THE ANGEL SPEAK
2608,A RING OF AMATHIST I COULD NOT WEAR HERE PLAIN OR TO MY SIDE THEN THAT FIRST KISS
2609,THAT WAS THE CHRISTM OF LOVE WHICH LOVE'S OWN CROWN WITH SAINT TO FIND SWEETNESS DID PROCEED THE THIRD UPON MY LIPS WAS FOLDED DOWN IN PERFECT PURPLE STATE SINCE WHEN INDEED I HAVE BEEN PROUD AND SAID MY OWN
2610,DEAREST TEACH ME SO TO POUR OUT GRATITUDE AS THOU DOST GOOD
2611,MUSLEANS AND GUILEERS THOUGH KERCHIEFS AT A SMILE AND HAVE NO ROOF FOR ANY WEEPING
2612,BUT THOU ART NOT SUCH A LOVER MY BELOVED
2613,THOU CANST WAIT THROUGH SORROW AND SICKNESS TO BRING SOULS TO TOUCH AND THINK IT SOON ONE OTHERS CRY TOO LATE
2614,I THINK ALL WHO HAVE LOVED ME IN THEIR HEARTS WE THANKS AND LOVE FROM MINE
2615,OH TO SHOOT MYSELF FULL MEANING INTO FUTURE YEARS THAT THEY SHOULD LEND IT UTTERANCE AND SALUTE LOVE THAT INDOORS FROM LIFE THE DISAPPEARANCE
2616,THEN I LONG TRIED BY NATURAL EELS RECEIVED THE COMFORT FAST WHILE BUDDING AT THY SIGHT MY PILGRIM'S STAFF GAVE OUT GREEN LEAVES WITH MORNING DOOMS AND PEARLS
2617,I LOVED THEE FREELY AS MEN STRIFE FOR RIGHT I LOVE THEE PURELY AS THEY TURN FROM PRAISE
2618,I LOVED THEE WITH THE PASSION PUT TO USE IN MY OLD REEDS AND WITH MY CHILDHOOD'S FAITH
2619,I LOVED THEE WITH A LOVE I SEEMED TO LOSE WITH MY LOST SAINTS I LOVE THEE WITH THE BREATH SMILE TO HEAR OF ALL MY LIFE AND IF GOD CHOOSE I SHALL BUT LOVE THEE BETTER AFTER DEATH
